It uses a so-called flotor as carrier of the stylus, which is kept in levitation by six electromagnetic voice coil actuators (VCA) in an hexapod-like arrangement. These VCAs function simultaneously as actuators and as force sensors, which are calibrated                     <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>                     according to the Kibble balance principle. Additionally, a position and orientation measurement system is integrated, consisting of three two-dimensional position sensors that can detect the position and orientation of the flotor in 6 DoF. The article describes the basic functionality as well as the most important technical functional elements and key design features. These features aim to optimise the metrological properties of probing force and position measurement in order to achieve the lowest possible measurement uncertainty. Furthermore, the structure of the peripheral electronics system for the controlling of the coordinate measuring head is described. So far, the conceptual and structural design has been implemented, two prototypes have been manufactured and put into operation. At the time of publication, initial metrological investigations are being carried out.                   </jats:p>

- **Unlocking the silent signals: Motor kinematics as a new frontier in early detection of mild cognitive impairment**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The increasing global prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) necessitates a paradigm shift in early detection strategies. Conventional neuropsychological assessment methods, predominantly paper-and-pencil tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, exhibit inherent limitations with respect to accessibility, administration burden, and sensitivity to subtle cognitive decline, particularly among diverse populations. This commentary critically examines a recent study that champions a novel approach: The integration of gait and handwriting kinematic parameters analyzed via  machine learning for MCI screening. The present study positions itself within the broader landscape of MCI detection, with a view to comparing its advantages against established neuropsychological batteries, advanced neuroimaging (e.g. , positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), and emerging fluid biomarkers (e.g. , cerebrospinal fluid, blood-based assays). While the study demonstrates promising accuracy (74.44% area under the curve 0.74 with gait and graphic handwriting) and addresses key unmet needs in accessibility and objectivity, we highlight its cross-sectional nature, limited sample diversity, and lack of dual-task assessment as areas for future refinement. This commentary posits that kinematic biomarkers offer a distinctive, scalable, and ecologically valid approach to widespread MCI screening, thereby complementing existing methods by providing real-world functional insights. Future research should prioritize longitudinal validation, expansion to diverse cohorts, integration with multimodal data including dual-tasking, and the development of highly portable, artificial intelligence-driven solutions to achieve the democratization of early MCI detection and enable timely interventions.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Successful coordination of the functional networks underlying reading is highly dependent on the underlying white matter tracts that connect these regions. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) can temporarily inhibit brain activity in targeted brain networks and has been shown to modulate reading ability. It was hypothesized that measures of diffusivity would predict change in reading efficiency following stimulation to the left temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), a targeted node of the dorsal stream of the reading network. Fifty-three adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years (M = 22.79, SD = 5.40; 34 female) with a range in reading ability completed sight word and pseudoword fluency measures prior to and immediately following cTBS to either the left or right TPJ or a control site. Participants also completed an MRI session including anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging sequences. Regression analyses were conducted to predict change in reading fluency following cTBS. Tracts associated with the reading network including the arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and portions of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, as well as the corpus callosum significantly predicted reliable change in a test of word reading efficiency–sight word efficiency subtest following stimulation of the left TPJ. These findings suggest that increased diffusivity of white matter tracts associated with the left hemisphere reading network and their right hemisphere homologues may support the impact of cTBS following stimulation to a targeted node of the reading network. Individual differences in white matter diffusivity may underlie differences in behavioral outcomes following neuromodulation.</jats:p>

- **Existence and uniqueness of solutions of Hilfer fractional neutral impulsive stochastic delayed differential equations with nonlocal conditions**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>In this work, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Hilfer fractional neutral impulsive stochastic delayed differential equations with nonlocal conditions. These equations, which are characterized by Hilfer fractional derivatives, stochastic perturbations, impulses, delays, and nonlocal components, naturally occur in a number of practical domains, including signal processing, control theory, and systems with memory and abrupt transitions. Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem is used to prove the existence of solutions, and the Banach contraction principle guarantees uniqueness. Two examples with particular parameter values are analyzed to show how the theoretical results are applicable. Graphical analysis is used to show how the solutions behave dynamically under different stochastic and impulsive inputs. Furthermore, simulations provide further details about the qualitative behavior of the solutions. By providing new insights into the theory of fractional stochastic differential equations with complex structures, this work broadens the potential applications of these equations in simulating real-world events.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The study focuses on the role of user orientation and artificial intelligence (AI) incorporation concerning clients’ experience in New York’s banking sector in the 5IR context. There, the aim is placed on identifying how these strategies influence sustainable customer development for the institute. A quantitative collection method is used to complete a survey with 97 Customer Experience (CX) Managers from 73 diverse banks in New York City on customer feedback integration, recommendation systems, personalisation levels, etc. Consequently, regression analysis provided substantial evidence of the relationships between these variables. The study reveals that user involvement and AI are crucial in reimagining banking innovation in the 5IR era. Customer engagement is critical and can only be solved by customer feedback and AI personalisation. Future studies may examine the consequences of these approaches on customers’ satisfaction and their continued patronage of a firm.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This research examines big data’s role in decision-making within Dubai’s technology and innovation sector, while centring predictive analytics in mediating effect. Whilst big data is widely identified across different industries, its direct impact on decision-making, alongside predictive analytics, remains underexplored. This research adopts a quantitative approach by using structured questionnaires to collect data from 117 supply chain managers across 130 organisations in Dubai. Besides, deductive approach and positivist research philosophy are employed to test the predefined hypotheses, exploring the relationships between predictive analytics, decision-making and big data. Our findings suggest that despite the accessibility of large datasets, several organisations face challenges in leveraging big data for effective decision-making. It is the case because of issues such as inadequate data management tools and information overload. Moreover, predictive analytics does not always enhance timeliness or decision quality, due to model inaccuracies and data integration challenges. To improve decision-making, organisations are encouraged to invest in well-structured and robust data infrastructure, develop clear strategies for utilising big data and provide training for decision-makers on predictive analytics tools. Basically, by working on predictive model accuracy while improving data quality, businesses can integrate big data into their decision-making processes effectively.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>                     This study proposes a simplified Coulombic model for the potential energy of resonant π-electrons in oligoenes and oligoynes, termed the snapshot model. The model shows that attractive electron–nucleus interactions dominate the net potential energy, with contributions represented by n                     <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>                     (2 m + 1) where m + 1 =  n. Application to hexatriyne reveals that potential energy profiles along the carbon chain mirror molecular topology. Experimental validation demonstrates strong predictive capability: the model exhibits logarithmic correlation with maximum wavelength absorption (λmax) for oligoenes ( R                     <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>                     = 0.98), enabling a priori prediction of optical properties from fundamental constants alone. Predictive power extends to thermodynamic properties, with logarithmic relationships to heat of combustion and parametrized heat of combustion for oligoynes. This cross-validation across multiple observables and molecular classes establishes the snapshot model as a robust predictive tool. The logarithmic relationships elucidate asymptotic saturation of conjugation stabilization, showing that physics-based simplified models can achieve predictive accuracy rivaling sophisticated computational methods.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The absence of customized prostheses for animals significantly limits the rehabilitation of amputated canines in Honduras. Due to the lack of local prosthetic solutions, full limb amputations are commonly performed, which eliminate the possibility of preserving functional joints. As a result, no clinical cases with partial limb preservation are available for study, this paper presents the design and validation of a modular canine exoprosthesis in a simulated transradial amputation scenario. Anatomical data were obtained through zoometry, plaster molding, and 3D scanning. The modular prosthesis was modeled in SolidWorks and Meshmixer, fabricated with FDM 3D printing. Materials used include carbon fiber-reinforced PETG for structural components and TPU with varying hardness for flexible sections. Structural validation was performed through finite element analysis (FEA), followed by experimental compression tests. Results show that the design and materials withstand peak gait forces within safe limits. The modular configuration proved effective for assembly and potential future adjustments. This study provides a technical foundation for the development of anatomically adapted canine prostheses in Honduras, offering an alternative that contributes to improving the quality of life of amputee dogs and supporting their rehabilitation within the local context.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study aims at examining the effect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) on innovation management (IM) in the UAE healthcare sector with a mediation of the Fifth Industrial Revolution (5IR). This quantitative and exploratory study sought causal effects between 4IR, 5IR, and IM. The survey received 288 valid responses from professionals representing different levels of management across 16 hospitals in the Abu Dhabi healthcare sector. The findings show that 4IR has direct effects on IM and, through 5IR, has substantial direct and indirect effects on IM, which means that technologies are important to modernise innovation within the healthcare constraint. The analysis outlines how the introduction and application of 5IR technologies act as a mediator that deepens the understanding of the connection between 4IR and IM in healthcare sustenance and advancement. The results highlight the importance of using 4IR and 5IR technologies as the recommendation reveals that increasing IM activities can bring drastic improvement to healthcare organisations in the UAE. Through the effective and targeted integration of these technologies, even lowly healthcare providers can achieve new levels of efficiency and enhance the delivery of patient care and services significantly.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This article investigates the constitutional narratives on freedom of expression employed by digital populist movements in the United States and Italy to oppose fact checking on social media platforms, which is where much of their political propaganda circulates. It argues that the platformisation of the public sphere has created a disintermediated media environment ideally suited to populist disinformation and post-truth discourse. Building on existing scholarship that characterises the populist constitutional approach as ‘mimetic’ and ‘parasitic’, the paper explores how digital populism exploits freedom of expression clauses to resist measures – whether public or private – aimed at countering disinformation on social media. Using prototypical cases from the United States and the European Union, it compares constitutional frameworks, populist strategies concerning platform regulation, and efforts to combat online disinformation, ultimately concluding that digital populists – an expression of media populism – employ constitutional rhetoric to shield social media spaces from any intermediation grounded in fact-based politics.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The Quarterly Model of the Banco de España (MTBE, by its Spanish acronym) is a large-scale macroeconometric model used for medium-term macroeconomic forecasting of the Spanish economy, as well as for performing scenario and policy simulations. The model is for a small, open economy within a monetary union. It is specified as a large set of error correction equations. This document presents an update of the model, which includes some specification changes and a re-estimation using data up to 2022. The main change in this version is the explicit inclusion of expectations in the main equations. This makes the model suitable for performing simulations under different assumptions about the way agents form their expectations. The update also enhances the financial channels included in the model and introduces additional detail in aspects that have gained importance in recent years, such as energy shocks.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies on disruptive innovation in the context of the food manufacturing industry in the UAE while focusing on the digital transformation as a mediator. Based on the primary data accumulated at different firms in the food manufacturing industry, the study examines how innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation, affect the innovations processes and effects. The results show that 4IR technologies improve disruptive innovation by a large extent and digital transformation plays a critical role of bridging the gap between the technologies and organisational practice. The findings of the present study have practical implications for accepting the 4IR technologies and the timely development of effective and holistic digital transformation strategy capable of spurring innovation in the field of food manufacturing industry. Furthermore, this research offers novelty to the existing literature by offering UAE-specific insights to explain what challenges and opportunities exist in this part of the world and how digitalisation can boost the impact of new technologies on innovation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Arabic dialects are often anecdotally described as existing on a continuum of guttural quality, driven by varying degrees of pharyngeal constriction. To empirically assess this, we collected phonetic data from two Jordanian dialects: rural and urban. We employ acoustic analysis and various metrics to quantify the upper and lower vocal tracts’ contribution to the production of emphatic sounds. Our analysis specifically aims to estimate the degree and location of articulatory constriction of emphatics in these dialects, and to identify the role of lip aperture in their production. We analyze vowel formants using generalized additive mixed models. Subsequently, we perform an articulatory estimation using the first two formants and their amplitudes to describe the labial posture and overall vocal tract configuration in emphatics. Our findings reveal that the rural dialect exhibits a more pronounced guttural quality, characterized by laryngopharyngeal constriction. In contrast, the urban dialect primarily shows upper pharyngeal (dorsal) constriction. Furthermore, the study reveals a causal relationship between lip protrusion and the degree and location of articulatory constriction of emphatics within the vocal tract.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>To play as a teaching method in higher education is, naturally, most in use in teacher education and the authors in this special issue responded on an international call inviting them to write about their research on play-based teaching. These articles, all together, cover parts of the gap of knowledge of play-based teaching with adult students. Play-based teaching in teacher education is a method to underline a professional signature: the students ought to know about teaching because they are going to teach children. It also might be a way for the students to learn: they play and appropriate the knowledge at the same time, just as children do. Playing can also be seen as a framework for building relations: an arena where the students dare to take risks and reflect critically within the classroom and in collaboration with the other students. The articles in this issue show different perspectives of play-based teaching.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Integration of blockchain technology in the banking sector signifies revolution, promising transparency, efficiency, and enhanced security within financial operations. This study investigates blockchain as a driver of business innovation in conjunction with digital platforms by examining variables such as traceability, efficiency, data security, and decentralisation. Capitalising on a Quantitative, Cross-Sectional approach, 33 Blockchain Project Managers from 15 banks in New York City contributed to this study. A key focus during data collection included the impact of blockchain on operational efficiency, product and service development, revenue growth, and market competitiveness. Findings indicate that blockchain’s decentralised and secure framework, amplified by digital platforms’ scalability and interoperability, significantly enhances innovation. Results highlight how digital platforms mediate in this relationship to maximise Blockchain’s transformative impact, providing efficient and adaptable infrastructures for banks to meet modern demands. However, it is recommended that blockchain be integrated to improve platform interoperability and enhance staff training, especially in high-security areas.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This research examines the mediating effect of green technologies (GTs) on the relationship between Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies and sustainable supply chain innovations in Texas’s manufacturing industry. This endeavour sought to assess the impact of 4IR enablers, including Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics, on sustainability as affected by GT, including renewable energy and energy-efficient spaces. A cross-sectional quantitative research approach was used, and survey questionnaires were sent to the identified supply chain managers from Texas’s manufacturing firms. Purposively, 332 participants were asked to fill in structured questionnaires from 297 manufacturing firms. Pre-survey data were collected and analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the direct and mediating paths between 4IR technologies, GTs, and sustainable supply chain innovations. Thus, the result confirms that endogenous mass 4IR technologies directly influence sustainable supply chain innovations, which are also mediated by GTs in this research. The research suggests that firms should aim at increasing their technological mileage, enhance the use of GT, and provide adequate training to supply chain managers. It is rightly suggested that future research should cover sectoral effects and longitudinal studies in order to understand how the function of 4IR technologies is changing regarding sustainability.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Basierend auf Analysen von Wahlprogrammen zeigt der Beitrag, dass die schulpolitischen Forderungen der Alternative für Deutschland zum Umgang mit der Shoah und der damit verbundenen Holocaust-Education sowie die Positionen der Partei im Kontext des Geschichtsunterrichts als ein Tabubruch bezeichnet werden können, da sie sich von einer ‚Erziehung nach Auschwitz‘ entfernen und antisemitischen Erzählungen im Schulkontext Raum geben.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The concept of well-being is inextricably linked to the social role that companies play within their ecosystems. To ensure the economic sustainability of their activities, companies must remunerate all factors of production, including risk capital, at market conditions, while producing goods and services that characterise daily life. Accounting and management theory recognises that corporate objectives cannot be reduced to the interests of specific stakeholder groups. The economic and social dimensions of organisations are inextricably intertwined, as economic coordination serves to satisfy human needs. It is obvious that the economic function of organisations is inextricably linked to their social role. At the same time, it should be noted that the territory itself generates well-being by providing companies with resources, services and a supportive environment. Territorial well-being, which combines social, environmental and infrastructural factors, has a positive impact on business performance. This study aims to develop two different indicators of well-being. The first measures the well-being that companies create for the community and the second vice versa. The methodology used in this study involves the initialisation of elementary indicators, which are then divided into domains and synthesised. These domains are then synthesised into a single indicator. The study uses non-linear and non-compensatory synthesis methods with the aim of providing companies with a strategic and operational tool to assess, measure and improve the wealth that the territory generates and preserves.</jats:p>
