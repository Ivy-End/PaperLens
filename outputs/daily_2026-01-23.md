  - 摘要：<jats:p>Artificial intelligence has quickly invaded the realms of both creative and information-based writing, raising new questions about human originality, authorship and style. Despite its ability to produce writings that are coherent and stylistically varied, there are still concerns over the uniqueness and cultural neutrality of AI programs such as ChatGPT. This review covers significant recent advancements with artificial intelligence applications in both the literary and non-literary fields. It analyzes 35 recent studies contrasting authorship and creativity, or stylistic considerations and impressions, between human and AI texts. These studies range from poetic and fictional writing through essay, news article and academic publications. Six main topics emerged:  Reconfiguring Authorship and Creativity in AI-Generated Literature; Disentangling Human and AI Authorship in informative and Creative Writing; Cultural Stereotyping, Stylistic Homogenization and Creative Constraints in AI-Generated Literary Content; Audience Perception, Misidentification and Heuristics in Informative Discourse; Educational Applications and Authorship Detection in AI-Generated vs. Human Texts; and Integration of AI into Special Research Fields such as Law, Criminology, Literature Reviews and Social Media. In particular, it was determined that though AI may have the ability to mirror humans on the basis of grammar, structure and at times a degree of creative literacy, it does not possess the capacity to address matters of deep emotional resonance and cultural context. However, at times humans cannot easily discern between texts written by AI and those authored by humans themselves, calling confidence and authority into question. Future studies could focus on how cultural background impacts the responses of people to AI-generated content, particularly in educational environments of colleges and universities.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study investigated the differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional assessment techniques in evaluating university students’ writing assignments, focusing on grammar, spelling, vocabulary, article usage, and writing mechanics. The research aimed to assess the accuracy of both methods, save instructors’ time, and address a gap in the literature. Fifty freshmen university students enrolled in a writing class (AHEE 101) at Qassim University participated. A mixed-methods comparative design was employed, where students’ writing was evaluated using both traditional grading and the AI tool QuillBot. Statistical analysis, specifically t-tests, showed no statistically significant difference in the overall writing scores between the two assessment methods (p &gt; 0.05). However, a detailed comparative analysis of individual writing components (grammar, spelling, vocabulary, article use, punctuation, and capitalization) revealed that the AI tool demonstrated a notable advantage in error detection accuracy. These findings suggest that AI can be a valid and effective supplementary tool for evaluating student writing. The study recommends that educators consider integrating AI into their assessment processes to enhance accuracy and effectiveness. Future research should include longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of AI-based feedback on students’ writing development.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>As artificial intelligence   becomes increasingly integrated into language learning, it offers conveniences like real-time feedback, yet ethical concerns such as data privacy and bias have surfaced. Despite its prevalence, a gap remains in understanding how learners navigate this dual experience. This exploratory study aims to examine the perceived conveniences learners experience through artificial intelligence, while investigating the ethical concerns influencing their engagement. Understanding this is significant for balancing innovation with ethical integrity. The study was conducted across three regions in the Philippines, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Luzon, and Western Visayas, to capture geographically diverse perspectives. Through purposive sampling, eighteen higher education students actively using artificial intelligence in their language studies participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Beyond pedagogical strengths, findings revealed that students value efficiency and vocabulary support but worry about accuracy and privacy. Crucially, they view artificial intelligence as a tool that cannot replace the empathy and cultural nuance of human teachers. Findings will inform educators, developers, and policymakers on prioritizing transparency and adopting a hybrid approach to language learning.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Developing writing skills is a central goal for English as a Foreign Language learners, yet large class sizes frequently limit instructors’ ability to provide timely and individualized Written Corrective Feedback. This study investigated how receiving corrective feedback from ChatGPT, compared with instructor feedback, influences Saudi English learners’ writing motivation and their experiences and perceptions in paragraph writing. The significance of the study lies in clarifying how AI-mediated feedback may support learners’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as conceptualized by Self-Determination Theory. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was adopted. Survey data from 52 preparatory-year students were analyzed descriptively, and interview data from 13 participants were examined through content analysis to identify themes related to motivation and feedback experiences. Findings revealed that learners valued ChatGPT’s immediacy and personalized explanations, and reported improvements in sentence structure, vocabulary use, and organization. Concerns about accuracy and occasional irrelevance persisted, and participants emphasized the continued importance of instructor guidance. The study concludes with the recommendation that ChatGPT be integrated as a complementary feedback tool to enhance writing development while maintaining teacher oversight to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter examines the interplay between population policies and political dynamics in China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea from 1945 onward. Emerging from war, occupation, and internal division, these states sought to redefine their roles in the new global order. Elites viewed population as a tool for economic growth and national stability, shaping policies to moderate population growth, ensure ethnic harmony, and promote “ideal” family structures. Ideologies of modernization and identity heavily influenced demographic policies, often distorting interpretations of population data. Notwithstanding these state efforts, declining marriage rates, rising marriage ages, and falling fertility characterized the era, as women increasingly resisted traditional family roles. Fertility rates continued to drop even as governments intensified pronatalist campaigns. This chapter highlights how demographic shifts, shaped by state ideologies and gender dynamics, intertwined with broader political agendas, reflecting the deep influence of population issues in postwar nation-building across Asia.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AI writing tools are becoming more crucial in helping university students with their English writing as generative AI in education continues to grow. This study explores how essential system features affect students’ writing performance through technology acceptance routes. And it also researches the moderating function of self-regulated learning. This study used a questionnaire survey to gather data from 531 English major students using a quantitative design. We used partial least squares structural equation modeling to examine the links between system features, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and writing performance. The findings demonstrate that perceived utility and perceived ease of use, which in turn affect attitudes and behavioral intentions, are highly predicted by AI system attributes. Behavioral intention positively affects writing performance, and self-regulated learning strengthens this relationship. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms through which AI tools enhance writing development and provide practical implications for improving AI tool design and integrating them into writing instruction. Future research should further examine long-term effects using longitudinal or process-based data.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study examined the independent use of ChatGPT by EFL students outside the classroom. It focused on how these Saudi EFL students used ChatGPT for essay writing and grammar learning without prior instruction. The study aimed to answer the following research questions: (1) How do EFL students use ChatGPT for essay writing? (2) How do EFL students incorporate ChatGPT into grammar learning? Eight participants were recruited using snowball sampling from a specific university in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected via semi-structured and stimulated-recall interviews, along with screen recordings of the student’s interactions with ChatGPT, and were analyzed thematically. The findings revealed that Saudi EFL students adopted two distinct approaches to using ChatGPT for essay writing. The first was a comprehensive, process-oriented approach in which students refined their ChatGPT use throughout various stages of the writing process. The second was a product-oriented approach in which students primarily relied on AI-generated essays and utilized the AI Humanizer feature. The findings also identified specific features that students adapted to enhance their grammar learning. The study concludes with pedagogical implications for EFL learning, highlighting the need to assess students’ writing processes, monitor their progress, and instruct them on the ethics of AI use and acceptable applications in academic settings. It provides valuable insights into how EFL students leverage ChatGPT for both essay writing and grammar learning.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Tumor heterogeneity is one of the central challenges in oncology, contributing to treatment resistance and disease recurrence. Bulk RNA sequencing has advanced understanding of tumor biology, yet its averaging effect conceals cell type-specific alterations. Single-cell RNA sequencing overcomes this limitation by capturing gene expression and cellular phenotypes with high-resolution, thereby illuminating tumor composition and the surrounding microenvironment. Within this framework, differential abundance (DA) detection has emerged as a powerful strategy to quantify shifts in cell population proportions across conditions. Unlike differential gene expression, DA highlights compositional changes in cellular ecosystems, offering a structural perspective on tumor dynamics. This review introduces the main categories of DA methods in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, outlining their modeling strategies, assumptions, and representative applications in oncology. We also discuss key challenges, including reliance on clustering quality and batch correction. By linking methodological principles with biological insight, this review clarifies the role of DA detection in single-cell oncology and provides a conceptual framework for integrating compositional analysis into efforts to understand tumor evolution, treatment response, and disease stratification.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The incorporation of artificial intelligence in teaching and learning environments, especially in English as a Second Language instruction, is constantly evolving. This has led to studies focusing on students’ perspectives, but there is a lack of research on educators’ experiences with artificial intelligence in classrooms. The paper provides an overview of educators’ perceptions and experiences with AI applications through a systematic review. This review synthesises 34 studies from 435 articles published between 2021 and 2024. The reviewed studies include countries from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa and involve both pre-service and in-service educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the Substitution-Augmentation-Modification-Redefinition model, this review identifies themes across pedagogical benefits, ethical concerns and implementation challenges. The findings show that most studies focused on the technical aspects of artificial intelligence rather than educators’ real experience applying it in classrooms. Hence, this paper recognises critical gaps, including the need for longitudinal studies on integration, frameworks for artificial intelligence-driven pedagogy, and professional development initiatives tailored to educators’ diverse levels of competence. This provides valuable guidelines for policymakers, institutions, and future researchers for bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and pedagogy. This review highlights the importance of educator-focused research and the inclusive exploration of artificial intelligence’s role in language instruction</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Generative Artificial Intelligence is increasingly used in language education; however, its effectiveness in supporting early academic writing has not been thoroughly evaluated through classroom-based research. This study investigates whether guided text-to-image prompting facilitates vocabulary acquisition, short-term retention, and the development of descriptive writing among Saudi foundation-year EFL students. The research emphasizes responsible, learner-authored applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which remain insufficiently explored, particularly in foundational EFL contexts where vocabulary and sentence-level development present ongoing challenges. Two B1-level classes (N = 50) at a Saudi public university were assigned to experimental and control groups for a six-week intervention. The experimental group engaged in vocabulary and writing tasks using text-to-image prompting, while the control group completed parallel text-based activities. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative measures included pre-, post-, and delayed vocabulary tests, as well as sentence-level assessments of lexical diversity, clause density, and modifier use. Qualitative analysis focused on mid- and post-intervention writing to evaluate linguistic integration and descriptive development. Results demonstrate that the experimental group outperformed the control group in vocabulary improvement, retention, sentence elaboration, and descriptive richness. Additionally, learners in the experimental group more consistently integrated target vocabulary into cohesive texts. The study concludes that guided text-to-image prompting serves as a pedagogically responsible multimodal supplement to traditional instruction and recommends further research on GenAI designs that enhance learner-generated language without replacing student writing</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Academic writing is a challenging process that requires a coherent expression of ideas, logical reasoning, and data-driven arguments. The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into academic writing has become important in recent years. The research paper examines the attitudes of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners toward AI language processing tools for academic writing. The authors aim to address the following question: What do Ukrainian EFL learners think about using AI to enhance their academic writing skills? This study aims to bridge the gap between scientific findings on Ukrainian EFL learners’ preferences and their actual use of AI language processing tools in academic writing tasks. To collect research data, online tools (Google Forms) were used and processed via a quantitative method. The second-year students training to become interpreters in the MA program (Philology, Germanic languages, literature (including translation), first foreign language – English) were the focus of the research. The findings suggest that Ukrainian EFL students have positive perceptions of using AI writing tools. The learners also report using AI language processing tools to provide ideas for their writing and to facilitate the composition of essays and paragraphs. The study is significant in promoting the broader use of AI tools for teaching English for Academic Purposes, as well as in identifying and addressing effective teaching techniques and methods.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study examines the role of artificial intelligence-generated content in foreign language instruction as a means of developing undergraduate students’ critical thinking skills. It aims to evaluate teaching strategies that encourage learners to analyze, revise, and reflect on digital texts. Earlier studies often treated artificial intelligence tools as merely a supportive aid; here, they are positioned as a source for critique. The authors exploited a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design.  The pedagogical experiment involved 64 first- and second-year students from intact classes at Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk National Pedagogical University in Ukraine. Participants were selected through convenience sampling from intact classes, with one class serving as the experimental group and another as the control.  The experimental group received instruction based on the proposed model, while the control group followed a traditional curriculum. Data were collected through pre‑ and post‑tests using the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), surveys, and classroom observations, and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings revealed that students in the experimental group demonstrated enhanced critical thinking skills, including the ability to question digital outputs, improved metacognitive awareness, and increased use of evidence-based reasoning. The study presents a pedagogical model that integrates technology with critical thinking objectives, promoting learner autonomy, digital literacy, and curriculum improvement. Future investigations should extend this model across disciplines and proficiency levels.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The recent technological development and the prevalent use of generative AI applications have rendered commitments to research ethics and integrity more challenging. This study investigates Moroccan doctoral students’ accounts of decision-making in English-language academic writing and publishing, alongside the institutional and relational conditions associated with those decisions. This study may be salient for higher education contexts in which formal ethics procedures and AI-related guidance remain uneven, in light of publication pressures and uncertain standards. Data were generated through semi-structured interviews with twelve doctoral candidates from multiple disciplines at two public Moroccan universities, and were subsequently analyzed thematically. The analysis yielded three interconnected themes: (1) institutional ethics infrastructure and its practical accessibility, (2) supervisory mentorship as a source of direction and accountability, and (3) peer-based norms shaping AI use in academic writing and expectations regarding disclosure. The findings suggest that unclear procedures and uneven supervision are associated with the growth of informal peer practices, heightened strain, and variable alignment with formal requirements. The article proposes a multi-level framework which links institutional environment, workgroup climate, and issue-specific evaluations of AI use to reported ethical practices. It also points to the value of structured ethics education, supervisor development initiatives, and clear guidance on AI transparency in academic work.</jats:p>

- **The Brat Brain: ChatGPT and the Crisis of Intellectual Effort in Language Education**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The rapid integration of ChatGPT into English language classrooms has introduced a troubling pedagogical shift in which learners increasingly outsource cognitive effort to artificial intelligence, bypassing processes of intellectual struggle, retention, and independent language development. This article critically examines how generative artificial intelligence, while often celebrated for accessibility and linguistic support, can foster learner dependency and undermine the development of sustained cognitive engagement. Drawing on extended classroom observations and reflective teaching practice within a United Arab Emirates higher education context, the study identifies recurring patterns of disengagement, superficial linguistic understanding, and a growing reluctance to grapple with language complexity. These behaviors are conceptualized through the notion of the Brat Brain, a metaphor used to describe a learner mindset that resists effort and critical thinking, demands instant solutions, and privileges convenience over intellectual growth. Rather than asking how to improve their writing or speaking, students increasingly question why such effort is necessary when artificial intelligence can produce faster and seemingly superior outputs. Reframing artificial intelligence use through the good, the bad, and the (educationally) evil, the article offers a critical lens for evaluating both the affordances and the unintended consequences of artificial fluency in language education. The study’s significance lies in its contribution to current debates on artificial intelligence in education by highlighting the pedagogical risks of uncritical adoption and arguing for a recalibration of instructional practices grounded in critical digital literacy, intellectual responsibility, and human-centered learning.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This paper investigates how Slovak CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) teachers´ digital literacy practices can serve as a foundation for developing artificial- intelligence (AI) literacy in bilingual education. Drawing on secondary analysis of the Digital Practices In and Out of the CLIL Classroom: A report for Slovakia by CLILNetLE Working Group 4 (Kováčiková &amp; Bagalová, 2024), the study examines data from CLIL teachers working in secondary schools with bilingual programs. The analysis focuses on their use of digital tools, self- assessed competences, perceived challenges, and awareness of Critical Digital Literacies (CDLs). Findings indicate that teachers demonstrate strong functional digital skills and regular technology integration yet limited critical engagement with emerging AI technologies. Their current practices reveal readiness for AI- supported pedagogy but a lack of conceptual and ethical frameworks to guide responsible use. The paper argues that explicit AI literacy training- combining technical, linguistic, and ethical dimensions- should be embedded in teacher education to prepare educators for AI- enhanced English academic writing and multilingual communication. Implications are offered for CLIL pedagogy, professional teacher development, and national policy on digital and AI competencies in education</jats:p>

The goal of this research was to investigate the use of artificial intelligence to augment scientific and technical writing among computer science students at the University of Tabuk. Thirty-five students aged nineteen to twenty years old participated in this study. This research employed quantitative research design. A survey questionnaire with 11 questions was designed to assess the university students’ perceptions of artificial intelligence use in learning. The study illustrated that students with a positive attitude toward artificial intelligence performed better, improved their language skills, and enhanced their learning. The study also established that artificial intelligence use among students increases academic writing. This research contributes significantly to understanding of how artificial intelligence impacts the scientific and technical writing proficiency of computer science students. Although artificial intelligence shows great potential, it should be seen as an additional tool that enhances rather than replaces the crucial function of human educators. In results indicate that, chatbot was demonstrated to significantly improve the writing skills of computer science students at the University of Tabuk through the use of artificial intelligence, including chatbots.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>In order to address enduring issues like uneven instructional quality, restricted access to personalized learning, and teacher shortages in English education, this study investigates how well ChatGPT-enhanced mobile learning improves English language proficiency among 150 Indian undergraduate students. The study uses a mixed-methods design that combines qualitative information from semi-structured interviews with quantitative analysis of pre- and post-test scores. After the intervention, paired-samples t-test results showed statistically significant gains in all core language skills. Thematic analysis also revealed worries about an excessive dependence on AI tools, along with perceived advantages like improved vocabulary, comprehension, and learner confidence. The results support ChatGPT’s potential as a flexible and user-friendly language learning tool, but they also emphasize the necessity of pedagogical approaches that foster learner autonomy and critical engagement. This study offers implications for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers looking for scalable and equitable learning solutions by placing AI-assisted mobile learning within the Indian higher education context. It also provides empirical evidence to debates on the responsible integration of AI in language education.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Pancreatic cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Current screening paradigms, which focus exclusively on high-risk individuals, leave the vast “low-risk” population unscreened. This conventional binary risk stratification, based predominantly on family history and known genetic syndromes, fails to incorporate emerging risk dimensions such as polygenic risk scores, lifestyle factors, and novel biomarkers. We propose a paradigm shift from this static model towards a dynamic, multidimensional risk stratification framework. By integrating genetic susceptibility (e.g. , newly identified variants in NOC2L , HNF4G ), lifestyle metrics (e.g. , new-onset diabetes), and liquid biopsy biomarkers (e.g. , circulating tumor DNA, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 dynamics), we can reclassify a subset of “low-risk” individuals who may benefit from targeted screening. The integration of artificial intelligence for prospective validation, as seen in ongoing trials, is crucial for implementing this approach.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the dynamics of academic writing, providing students with new linguistic resources but also posing serious questions about the validity, authorship, and credibility of academic writing. In this study, we explore how critical AI literacy can be meaningfully incorporated within academic writing classes and explore the linguistic, cognitive, and ethical aspects of students’ engagement with AI technology. Employing a mixed-method study that included 50 undergraduates from the Uzhhorod national university, we explore the participants’ initial attitudes and practices, explore key challenges faced in their engagement with AI-produced texts, and examine their abilities to interpret and verify the validity of AI-produced texts. A set of educational interventions, such as text comparison, bias detection, genre-specific validation, and reflective writing exercises, were conducted to enable students to develop critical AI literacy. Results show that students seriously lacked discernment in verifying the authenticity of AI-produced content but immensely improved their abilities after engaging in the educational interventions. The study concludes that critical AI literacy can be effectively included within academic writing classes, teaching students to use AI tools appropriately without undermining the credibility and authenticity of academic writing. Findings also indicate that serious consideration is needed for universities to address the opportunities and challenges posed by AI tools in higher educational contexts.</jats:p>
