On average, tourism slogan has 3.84 words, with content word and affective word ratio of 0.82 and 0.50, respectively. It was also found that tourism slogans, on average, have statistically significantly higher valence (pleasure) and dominance (empowerment) scores than the ANEW database. The top thematic patterns identified from tourism slogans are “action verbs”, “positive emotions” and “nature”. The most prominent linguistic features are “pronouns”, “sound device”, “figurative language”, “imperative” and “personification”. Perusing the Nature Earth Database, a world map of geographical distribution based on three clusters of tourism slogans was created. Combined with circular dendrogram, this tourism slogan map visualizes the potential strategic alliance among destinations with similar affective qualities for their tourism slogans. Theoretically, this paper applied ANEW database to make it possible including affect in studies of tourism slogans semantics, turning usually qualitative content analysis into multivariate data analysis such as cluster analysis. Pragmatically, it helps to understand the thematic patterns and linguistic features of tourism slogans. These findings may serve as general guidelines in creating tourism slogans. Pedagogically, two user interfaces were customarily developed with the assistance of chatbots to meet the needs of tourism slogans analysis. This paper demonstrates that, with basic coding skills and prompt guidance, researchers can now design their own research tools.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents a transformative opportunity to address educational inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The educational landscape is at the crossroads where strategic adoption of free and open GenAI could fundamentally transform learning equity. This chapter builds a case on how emerging openly accessible models are creating unprecedented opportunities that, if well utilized, can bridge educational gaps that plague this region. Unlike the proprietary systems, these openly accessible models may significantly lower deployment costs and offer adaptable architectures for low-resource environments that are synonymous with sub-Saharan Africa. The chapter outlines practical and actionable strategies, including policy reviews and formulation where none exist to including hybrid deployment systems combining offline AI capabilities. Teacher trainings that focus on prompt engineering with open-source tools and public-private partnerships to ensure sustainable implementation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Edge time series decompose functional connections into their fine-scale, framewise contributions. Previous studies have demonstrated that global high-amplitude “events” in edge time series can be clustered into distinct patterns. However, whether events and their patterns change or persist throughout the human lifespan has not been investigated. Here, we directly address this question by clustering event frames using the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland sample that includes subjects with ages spanning the human lifespan. We find evidence of two main clusters that appear across subjects and age groups which systematically change in magnitude and frequency with age. Our results also demonstrate that such event clusters have distinct, heterogeneous relationships with structural connectivity-derived communication measures, which change with age. Finally, event clusters were found to outperform nonevents in predicting phenotypes regarding human intelligence and achievement. Collectively, our findings fill several gaps in current knowledge about cofluctuation patterns in edge time series and human aging, setting the stage for future investigation into the causal origins of changes in functional connectivity throughout the human lifespan.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Existing bioelectronics often exhibit megapascal-scale moduli, despite the mechanosensitive nature of cardiomyocytes. Bridging the mechanical mismatch between tissue and bioelectronics is indispensable for building physiologically relevant in vitro cardiac models and advancing therapies. Here, we present Pliable Ultrathin Layered Sensing Electronics (PULSE), a platform with tissue-matched modulus (~10 kilopascals) and stretchable gold microcircuitry for long-term, high-fidelity monitoring of cardiac electrophysiology in vitro. Composed of a soft gel matrix and an ultrathin nanofilm embedded with gold circuits, our device achieves unprecedented tissue integration and preserves natural cardiomyocyte mechanics, resulting in a 140% increase in mechanical contraction and a 100% increase in electrical signals compared to conventional electronics. Cardiac tissue that grows our device exhibited enhanced drug sensitivity and response in cardiac dysfunction, revolutionizing disease modeling. By facilitating seamless interaction at the tissue-electronic interface, our platform offers a transformative perspective for advancing cardiac modeling and next-generation bioelectronic applications.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>                     Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are emerging environmental pollutants, yet their behavior in the atmosphere remains poorly understood. Using an innovative method capable of detecting plastic particles as small as 200 nanometers, we quantified MPs and NPs in aerosols, dry and wet deposition, and resuspension in two Chinese megacities, Guangzhou and Xi’an. Airborne concentrations reached 1.8 × 10                     <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>                     MPs per cubic meter and 5.0 × 10                     <jats:sup>4</jats:sup>                     NPs per cubic meter in Guangzhou and 1.4 × 10                     <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>                     MPs per cubic meter and 3.0 × 10                     <jats:sup>4</jats:sup>                     NPs per cubic meter in Xi’an. Estimates revealed a variation of two to five orders of magnitude in MP and NP fluxes across major atmospheric compartments, dominated by road dust resuspension and rainfall-driven wet precipitation. Plastic particles were more heterogeneously mixed in deposition samples than in aerosols and resuspension, indicating enhanced aggregation and removal. These results provide an integrated assessment of MPs and NPs in urban atmospheric processes and offer critical insights into their transformation, fate, and potential implication for climate, ecosystems, and human health.                   </jats:p>

- **An Epiphany Into the COVID-19 Crisis-Induced Influence on the 'Otherly' Abled**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The nuanced structural invisibility in the social phenomenon is suggestive of it being inclined towards the normatively accepted standards of ‘normality'. The failure to fit into the accepted standards and definition of normality often results in being ‘othered'. Progressive legislation, policies, and guidelines have been enacted both pre-dated and during the Covid-19 pandemic only to delimitate categories between the ‘abled' and the ‘differently-abled'. Human behavior and inclusivity, a basic expectation from the social phenomenon, that is considered to be the mainstream idea behind such policies is still a dream far from reality. The academic gap between the normatively accepted definition of ‘abled' and those being ‘othered that is the differently-abled existed even prior to the Covid-19 Pandemic, however, post-dated-pandemic-era the gap has only exacerbated. The article seeks to examine how the pandemic has induced exacerbation of ‘othering'.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study examines numerical modeling of concentrated leak erosion in cohesive soils under turbulent flow conditions using the Hole Erosion Test (HET). Internal erosion, where soil particles detach due to subsurface flow, significantly weakens structures like dams and dikes, potentially causing floods.The study made a model to show erosion using changing meshes at the spot where water meets soil. It uses rules based on key shear force and erosion numbers. The model was tested for pipe erosion in 2D with slow water. It was then checked against the HET model. Two different soils were tested successfully using this approach, followed by a study to see how erosion factors change erosion speed and channel size. This model was proved to work when looking at experiments and Bonelli's papers. It shows leak erosion well while giving helpful flow data to better know how erosion works.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The conclusion considers the future of refugee humanitarianism and Kenyas mandatory encampment policy. It discusses the Shirika Plan, a new joint effort by the Kenyan government, UNHCR and foreign donors to turn the country's existing refugee camps into self-sustaining settlements that benefit both refugees and the welfare of local Turkana communities. This developmental pipedream, however, runs counter to more radical aspirations to decolonize carceral humanitarianism, by abolishing camps altogether, through which the post/colonial power of aid is ultimately reproduced and made material. Given the persistence of ethnic territoriality, exclusionary nationalism, mobility policing and the logics of land enclosure in present-day Kenya, undoing the ills of refugee encampment will require nothing less than a remaking of its social fabric.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The chapter delves into the social terrain of the community to show its ambivalence as both a source of collective identity and a target for governmental control through indirect rule. Empirically, it focuses on the Community Peace and Protection Teams (CPPTs), a community policing program in Kakuma that enrolls refugees from different ethnic backgrounds into security work. Through their deputization, however, CPPTs get caught between the liberal efforts of humanitarian organizations to promote self-protection and the Kenyan state’s attempts to maximize its authority over camp dwellers by means of localized violence work. Although this puts refugee officers in a double bind, they are often able to use their in-between position for the benefit of their own deep community.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>According to Anglo-Saxon geopolitical theory, Turkey is a key part of Rimland. Its geographical position gives it the privilege of becoming a crossroads of Western markets, but also of many unstable, geostrategically and economically important regions, such as the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian Sea region. This paper analyses Turkey's energy needs and argues that in order to meet its growing energy demand, Turkey is trying to transform its energy mix by reaching out to global and regional actors in order to become a focal point for energy trade in the region and a natural gas hub, taking advantage of its geographical position and access to energy-rich neighbors, without having hydrocarbon resources of its own. This energy dependence has an impact on its internal and foreign policy, as reforms will have to be designed and implemented to meet both its internal challenges and its geopolitical ambitions.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Using artificial intelligence (AI) tools in education is a contemporary method that enhances the evaluation, transformation, and promotion of learning and teaching processes. Integrating AI tools into the learning process in STEM fields contributes to the development of students' metacognitive abilities. This study aims to learn and evaluate adolescents' opinions and insights regarding the use of AI tools in STEM fields. Our research examines students' attitudes, confidence, and perceptions towards using AI tools and their perspectives on current global issues. Their views on the use of digital AI tools to solve these problems are also explored. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with eight participants for the study. The collected data were analyzed using content analysis methods. A review of the relevant literature revealed no studies similar to the methodology of this study. In this regard, we believe that the results of our study will benefit researchers conducting studies on the use of AI tools in education especially towards STEM education.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The incorporation of rubber aggregates in SCC significantly affects fluidity, viscosity, and passing ability. In the research presented here, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method is adopted with a combination of the CRITIC method and Taguchi-TOPSIS optimization in order to evaluate the rheological properties of RSCC. The eighteen SCC mixes with varying percentages of rubber, ranging from 5% to 30%, are evaluated in terms of slump flow, V-funnel flow time, L-box passing ability, viscosity, and yield stress. The results show that when the proportion of a single type of rubber granule exceeds 20%, the rheological properties of the blend, such as flowability and passability, are significantly degraded. This contrasts with the combination of several types of rubber (20% fine rubber and 25% coarse rubber). This suggests that a homogeneous mixture can help reduce the adverse effects associated with high individual rubber contents,with enhanced sustainability and retention in self-compaction. The optimization analysis of 18 RSCC formulations indicated that RSCC5/G achieved the highest proximity score (C=1.0), while mixes having rubber content exceeding 20% had proximity scores less than 0.8, pointing to significant rheological decline.</jats:p>

However, equitable human development requires inclusive policies, as rapid economic growth alone is insufficient. Additionally, foreign green finance promotes governance by encouraging transparency and regulatory reforms, while trade openness drives institutional improvements. Nonetheless, economic instability, such as high inflation or erratic growth, poses risks to governance quality.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study fills a key gap in the literature by moving beyond aggregate green finance measures to isolate the role of foreign green finance in emerging economies.

  - 摘要：<jats:p>One of the most significant transformations in 21st century Korean society is its emergence as a multicultural and multireligious context. Historically, Korea has been identified as a ‘homogeneous nation’, fostering exclusivist attitudes towards ethnic minorities, migrants, and non-Korean religious traditions. In this rapidly shifting global environment, Korean society must adapt, but the role of Korean Christianity in resisting such change cannot be overlooked. Despite Christianity’s central teaching of love for one’s neighbour, many Korean churches have exhibited exclusivism towards foreigners and immigrants, rooted in two factors: prejudices that identify migrants as potential criminals, and fears that the influx of ‘foreign religions’ (such as Islam) might threaten Christian identity. While some Korean churches have cooperated with civic groups on immigrant issues, the dominant trajectory of Korean Christian theology often reinforces exclusionary attitudes. Some theological studies have proposed alternatives, but most are confined to the New Testament concept of ‘hospitality’, which proves structurally inadequate to address deeper challenges of immigrant acceptance. This concept tends to create an imbalanced relationship between immigrants and native residents. This study proposes ‘ontological ὁµοιός’, centred on incarnation texts in the New Testament, to transcend these limitations. Contribution: This study presents a new theological paradigm to address prejudices and exclusionary attitudes towards immigrants in Korean society. By helping Korean Christianity move beyond its dualistic approach and embrace authentic neighbour-love, it contributes to transforming Korea from a closed to an open society. Most significantly, it advances immigrant reception discourse by introducing ‘ontological identification’ (ὁµοιός) as a superior alternative to the hospitality framework, establishing a scholarly foundation for multicultural integration within Christian theology. Contribution: This study provides a novel theological paradigm addressing prevalent prejudices and exclusionary attitudes towards immigrants in Korean society. By helping Korean Christianity transcend its dualistic approach and embrace authentic neighbour-love, it contributes to transforming Korea from a closed to an open society. Most significantly, this study advances immigrant reception discourse by introducing ‘ontological identification’ (ὁµοιός) as a superior alternative to the traditionally dominant ‘hospitality’ framework, thereby establishing a more developed scholarly foundation for multicultural integration within Christian theological studies.</jats:p>
