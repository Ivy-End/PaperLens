  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>                     This paper defines the relationship between units within a single, homogeneous sign as                     <jats:italic>intrasemiotic relations</jats:italic>                     , while the relationship between heterogeneous semiotic elements discovered within a sign is termed                     <jats:italic>intersemiotic relations</jats:italic>                     . The                     <jats:italic>principle of differentiation</jats:italic>                     , also referred to as the                     <jats:italic>heterogeneous double-coding principle</jats:italic>                     , aims to uncover intersemiotic relationality where intrasemiotic relations are conventionally assumed. Based on this principle, the paper analyzes the intersemiotic relationality of Chinese characters, specifically: (1) the                     <jats:italic>object-sign relation</jats:italic>                     and                     <jats:italic>langue-image relation</jats:italic>                     on the expressive plane of Chinese characters; (2) the                     <jats:italic>object-signification relation</jats:italic>                     on the content plane; and (3) the                     <jats:italic>instance relation</jats:italic>                     on the signification (mode) plane. The paper argues that Chinese characters belong to heterogeneous intersemiotic relations rather than the homogeneous intrasemiotic relations of alphabetic writing. Chinese characters pertain to semiotics rather than linguistics. The implicit heterogeneous intersemiotic relational model of Chinese characters may facilitate a civilizational-level dialogue and mutual learning with Western formalized homogeneous semiotics, which is rooted in alphabetic culture.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The Metaverse is an expansive digital universe that can redefine traditional businesses and financial services. It represents a transformative space where virtual worlds intersect with digital assets, offering novel opportunities for businesses to redefine financial services. Despite the rapid growth of digital financial services, financial exclusion remains a major challenge, with approximately 1.4 billion adults globally still unbanked. This study explores the role of Metaverse banking (MB) in financial inclusion, highlighting its opportunities and challenges. This study explores the emergence of MB as a catalyst for financial inclusion within the virtual business world. By integrating MB with financial inclusion theories, the paper presents a conceptual framework to analyze opportunities and risks in this domain. The findings provide practical insights for banks, policymakers, and fintech companies on leveraging MB for inclusive economic development.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The rapid development of the Metaverse introduces significant challenges. This study explores the multifaceted challenges of the Metaverse to assess public concerns. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issues shaping the use of the Metaverse. Drawing on a dual methodological perspective by combining a literature review representing academic insights with web analytics demonstrating real-time web trends, we examine these challenges and highlight their implications for the future of the Metaverse. The study categorizes into four primary concerns, which are privacy and security, ethical issues, societal impact, and regulatory challenges. Privacy and security emerged as the most critical concern, emphasizing the need for robust data protection measures to safeguard user rights amidst growing surveillance risks, identity theft, and cyber threats. Additionally, societal concerns include digital inequality, social isolation, and shifts in communication. Regulatory challenges stem from the inadequacy of the current legal framework. The findings highlight the necessity of stakeholder collaboration to address these issues and propose policy implications to ensure the Metaverse develops as an inclusive, secure, and sustainable digital ecosystem. The study integrates a systematic literature review with web analytics and provides a novel perspective bridging theoretical discourse with real-world digital trends. The findings offer policy recommendations to foster a secure, inclusive, and sustainable Metaverse ecosystem. Future research directions are suggested to expand understanding and guide effective policymaking in this transformative space.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The study explores the foundational enablers of Marketing 6.0 in the metaverse, emphasizing the integration of advanced technologies, sustainability, and hyper-personalization to foster a human-centric marketing paradigm. As technological innovation accelerates and consumer expectations evolve postpandemic, Marketing 6.0 emerges as a critical framework for future marketing strategies. Consumers increasingly seek immersive experiences that bridge digital and physical realms, posing challenges in capturing and converting physical interactions into actionable digital insights. To address this, the research introduces a three-layered framework that redefines consumer engagement through immersive, tech-enabled experiences. It highlights the need for brands to cultivate authentic relationships, trust, and loyalty amid information overload and growing skepticism. Key technologies—augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and blockchain—enhance interactivity and foster community in virtual settings. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming consumer-brand dynamics, offering deeper insights and personalization. By synthesizing current literature and case studies, the study delivers practical guidance for marketers navigating this complex landscape. It presents a strategic roadmap for applying Marketing 6.0 principles, enabling brands to stay relevant and competitive in a rapidly evolving environment. This transformative approach reimagines engagement, blending innovation with meaningful consumer experiences.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Reading ability depends on multiple cognitive skills, including decoding and language comprehension, which can vary widely across individuals—even among those with similarly low reading performance. To better understand the brain basis of this variability, we used connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to identify large-scale functional connectivity patterns associated with reading and language skills in a population-based sample. Cross-sectional CPM models were trained using functional connectivity data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (n = 6894) and tested in two independent cohorts: the New Haven Lexinome Project and the Genes, Reading, and Dyslexia study (combined n = 136). Functional connectivity measures included both resting- and task-based scans. Reading and language were measured with psychometric tests of word reading and vocabulary, respectively. CPM models significantly predicted reading (r = .24) and language (r = .28) scores in the discovery sample and generalized to an external sample (rs = .23 and .19). Anatomically, the reading and language models showed significant overlap, with the medial frontal network emerging as most predictive in both. However, these models exhibited distinct generalization patterns to children with decoding versus language comprehension difficulties—classified using 20th percentile cutoffs—highlighting their neural specificity. Reading and language models included distinct connectivity signatures and generalized differently to children with decoding versus language comprehension difficulties. These findings demonstrate that although reading and language abilities are behaviorally related, they are supported by partially distinct neural architectures. Integrating behavioral and neuroimaging data may clarify specific brain–behavior relationships and inform more tailored interventions for children with reading and language difficulties.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Thomas Merton foresaw the potential for technology to displace spirituality and dehumanise society. His warnings about the danger of replacing angels with machines and the geopolitical power struggles between Gog and Magog are explored in the light of Merton’s concerns about the spiritual implications of technological progress and the erosion of human values. Merton’s prophetic spirituality, characterised by simplicity, solitude and authenticity, and his critique of technological civilisation’s impact on language and culture are examined in relation to Merton’s reflections on the invisibility of technology and its influence on human perception, along with his call for a return to spiritual guidance and community. Merton’s views on the geopolitical dynamics of the 21st century are also addressed, drawing parallels between his era and contemporary global relations. Ultimately, the importance of heeding Merton’s warnings and seeking solutions from the global south to navigate the challenges posed by technologica</jats:p>

- **Retinotopic Spatial Working Memory Representations Are Not Affected by Task-irrelevant Visual Stimuli**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance and manipulation of information no longer accessible in the world. Previous research has identified spatial WM representations in sustained activation patterns in visual, parietal, and frontal cortex, while MEG/EEG studies have additionally supported a role for “activity-silent” mechanisms revealed by transient reactivation or amplification of an existing representation by a task-irrelevant “ping” stimulus. In natural vision, the delay period between encoding information into WM and its use to guide behavior is rarely “empty,” as is the case in many laboratory experiments. Instead, eye movements, movement of the individual, and events in the environment result in visual inputs that may overwrite or impair the fidelity of WM representations, especially in early sensory cortices. Here, we evaluated the extent to which a brief, irrelevant interrupting visual stimulus presented during a spatial WM delay period impaired behavioral performance and retinotopic WM representation fidelity assayed using an inverted encoding model. On each trial, participants (both sexes) viewed two target dots and were immediately postcued to remember the precise spatial position of one dot. On 50% of trials, a brief interrupter stimulus appeared. While we observed strong transient univariate visual responses to the interrupter stimulus, we saw no change in reconstructed neural WM representations due to this interruption, nor a change in behavioral performance on a continuous recall task. This suggests that spatial WM representations can be robust to interference from incoming task-irrelevant visual information, perhaps related to their role in guiding movements.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This present chapter examines the crucial and particularly important role of emotions in the learning process, focusing on the “emotional brain” and its connection to learning, particularly in the context of paediatric oncology. The role played by emotions and the emotional state of individuals is not just a secondary factor in learning, but a critical element affecting executive functions. Brain structures play a key role in the regulation of emotion and cognitive function.The challenge in the case of children with cancer is particularly great, as emotional regulation and mental resilience influence to a significant extent how children respond to learning challenges. Significant barriers to mastery of emotional and cognitive development are played by the disease and its accompanying experiences. The role of neuropedagogy is to provide an innovative, structured and targeted framework for enhancing the emotionality of children with cancer, combining knowledge from neuroscience, psychology and pedagogy.</jats:p>

Additionally, the paper, which follows a quantitative approach, examines the sociocultural and linguistic implications of using these loanwords, especially in the context of code-switching and the adaptation of foreign terms into the Arabic lexicon. Through this exploration, the research seeks to understand the broader impact of English borrowings on Arabic language evolution in digital spaces and the potential long-term consequences for cultural and linguistic identity. It is hoped that this paper will be followed by a more elaborate study on borrowing from English and other languages in conversational Arabic in the Arabian Peninsula to be carried out from a Cognitive Linguistic perspective.</jats:p>
