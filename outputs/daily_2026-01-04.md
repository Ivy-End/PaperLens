  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter invites readers to engage in open-minded critical thinking. By developing their ability to engage in evidence-based critical thinking and making a conscious attempt to think more and better, they can transform themselves into Thinkers. Its practical exercises prompt readers to form reasoned opinions from scratch, to rethink their current beliefs, and more challenging still, to reexamine beliefs to which they are emotionally attached. By doing this, the chapter encourages readers to think rather than feel their way to conclusions. It thereby motivates individuals to embrace a disciplined approach that cultivates robust, reality-grounded reasoning and a commitment to continual intellectual advancement.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Steel manufacturing involves complex scheduling because of the interdependence between the steelmaking and rolling processes. This study proposes an integrated scheduling model for long-term planning of these processes under uncertainty. The proposed model abstracts an existing detailed scheduling model using two key techniques: charge integration and rolling process simplification. Through numerical experiments, we evaluated the characteristics and effectiveness of the model under different objective functions and time and resource buffer allocation strategies. The results demonstrate that the model achieves computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter outlines the transformation necessary for one to evolve into a fully engaged Thinker, emphasizing the deliberate optimization of the mind through evidence-based inquiry. It presents a Thinker as someone who actively evaluates claims and selectively embraces unconventional ideas that are well defended. The chapter details key traits such as intellectual omnivorousness, skepticism, epistemic humility, and the ability to manage complex ideas without succumbing to intellectual complacency. It contrasts Thinkers with Feelers by demonstrating that Thinkers reserve judgment until they have scrutinized all supporting evidence and welcome criticism to refine their understanding. Finally, the chapter emphasizes that continuous mindful thinking and disciplined metacognition empower individuals to steadily advance their intellectual journey.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>What occurs in the brain when entrepreneurs make decisions, or are in the process of making them? Is the study of decision-making through cognito-management processes relevant for understanding entrepreneurial behaviour? Entrepreneurs frequently seek more information than is necessary, resulting in delays caused by the time required to process that information. Such delays can impair decision effectiveness. Cognito-management seeks to explain decision-making in terms of the capacity to process multiple alternatives and to select an optimal course of action. It examines how management behaviour shapes our understanding of the brain and informs models of management practice. This paper asks what coherent brain dynamics underlie prediction, control, and decision-making. Theoretical explanations suggest that the brain accomplishes these functions through neural computations. Deciphering such processes requires an understanding of the cognito mechanisms that implement value-dependent decision-making. This leads to the formulation of a cognito-management decision-making paradox. The aim of this paper is to explore how the brain implements decisions in ways that are directly tied to observable behaviour, and to propose a model of cognito-management decision-making that integrates cognitive, emotional, and managerial levels of analysis.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Africa stands at a pivotal crossroads—marked by persistent socioeconomic inequalities, environmental fragility, and complex development challenges, yet also rich in cultural assets, indigenous knowledge, and youth-driven creativity. Despite impressive economic growth in recent decades, the benefits of development have remained unevenly distributed, often excluding the very populations most in need. Conventional models of innovation have failed to address the continent’s unique sociocultural, ecological, and institutional realities.  This groundbreaking book offers a radical rethinking of innovation as a driver of inclusive and sustainable transformation in Africa. It explores how innovation can be reimagined not solely as a vehicle for economic growth, but as a catalyst for social equity, environmental resilience, and community empowerment.  Through case studies, theoretical contributions, strategic frameworks, and actionable toolkits, the book challenges traditional hierarchies of knowledge and power, proposing a pluralistic, participatory, and justice-oriented innovation paradigm aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).It inspires a new generation of African innovation leaders committed to systemic change, ethical leadership, and sustainable development grounded in equity, dignity, and collective well-being.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter introduces how the World Wide Web expands the reach of malicious actors by removing gatekeepers and amplifying hate speech, smear campaigns, and disinformation. It traces the web’s evolution from a research network that tech‑savvy users lead in the 1960s to a user‑friendly platform in the early 1990s, noting how directories give way to search engines and how Google’s PageRank algorithm reshapes information discovery. The chapter explains how search algorithms and targeted advertising foster filter bubbles that isolate individuals within echo chambers, exacerbate tribalism, and hinder democratic discourse by fragmenting shared perceptions of reality. It explores how social media and artificial intelligence further intensify these dangers by enabling anonymous harassment, realistic fake content, and manipulative algorithms that exploit human psychology for commercial and political ends. Finally, the chapter emphasizes that thinkers must guard against these threats by critically evaluating information, resisting the outsourcing of thought to technology, and preparing to engage with a public increasingly detached from reality.</jats:p>

- **Epistemic reparations and disability**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Epistemic reparations are argued to be deserved by those wronged by gross injustices and violations, to provide redress for epistemic wrongs incurred by victims and survivors. I apply epistemic reparations and Lackey’s (2022, 2025) “right to be known” to disability injustice. This novel exploration makes three contributions. First, that given widespread historical and contemporary injustice and violations incurred by disabled people – material and epistemic – theoretical resources such as Lackey’s, which aim to account for epistemic wrongs and ameliorate injustice, should have significant value for the pursuit of disability justice. As I demonstrate, this application permits identification of ways in which disabled people are epistemically wronged, and how the concept of disability can be used to wrong, or malign, others. Second, as disability intersects with other populations, taking disability into consideration here serves others contexts of epistemic reparations. Third, despite the potential value of, and need for, epistemic reparations for disability justice, I submit that this will likely be forestalled without acknowledging and addressing the neglect of disability – particularly intellectual disability – in social epistemological theorising. This neglect incurs the cost of some existing theories in the domain being unable to account for the ways in which some disabled people – those with intellectual disability – can be epistemically wronged, or even considered knowers and agents. Through applying Lackey’s framework of epistemic duties, I demonstrate that ameliorating this neglect is epistemically reparative work in itself, as well as being required to realise the value of epistemic reparations for those wronged due to disability status.</jats:p>
