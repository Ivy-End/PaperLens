  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter illustrates a complete framework of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twins (DTs) use to reinvent quality control in the supply chain sector. The situation has changed rapidly over the years and simple methods in the supply chain field are now insufficient. Nowadays, it is difficult to keep up with the fast pace of global supply chain while sticking to the traditional methods for managing it. One of the biggest bottlenecks in today’s supply chain sector is the problem of quality control which has been handled traditionally. The integration of AI and DTs is not just a step forward but a significant advancement in supply chain quality management (SCQM) technologies.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Much of the chapter is set aside to explain AI and DTs in supply chain context which involves an in-depth look at their creation, maintenance, and the effectiveness of real-time monitoring and simulation. The relation between AI and DTs is also discussed by showing that these two technologies enable prediction-based repairs, self-decision-making, and the perfection of quality processes without the need for interventions. The chapter comprises a sequential framework and a roadmap for its implementation.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>In conclusion, a visionary view on the future of SCQM in the era of AI and DTs pointing to this technology as a focal element in the continual upgrading of the contemporary business world is presented.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Complex interactive media, particularly simulated games, communicate meaning and evoke emotions through their elements. This study employs a visual semiotics approach to examine the semiosis that affects player interactions and game design in multiplayer virtual games. It analyzes the three main modalities used to convey meaning in these games: visual elements, auditory components, and textual attributes. The SimCity game series is purposefully selected for the study, and the findings from the connotative and denotative analysis demonstrate how the game vividly mirrors actual urban challenges through its design, intertwining entertainment with a critique of civic duty and government. The study draws insights from neoliberalism, capitalism, and Foucault’s theories, demonstrating that simulation games like SimCity cultivate a broader sense of humanity and responsibility while augmenting player agency. The study shows that in SimCity, the player occupies the role of a formidable administrator inside a dynamic urban environment, where governance, economic stability, and social order are perpetually tested. The game illustrates non-Marxist principles by prioritizing efficiency, control, and continuous progress. This semiotic study demonstrates how the game quietly reflects genuine urban challenges through its design, merging enjoyment with a critique of civic duty and government.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This paper presents a comprehensive database of geopolitical risk (GPR) indices for 34 countries, constructed using a standardized textual analysis methodology applied to national news sources. Building on the framework introduced in Alonso-Alvarez et al. (2025), we calculate both general and bilateral GPR indices that reflect the intensity and origin of geopolitical tensions as perceived in domestic media narratives. The indices are derived from a dictionary-based approach applied to press articles accessed via the Factiva platform, with queries translated into 15 languages to ensure linguistic and cultural relevance. Bilateral indices focus on four key regions – Russia, China, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the Western Bloc – capturing how each country perceives external geopolitical threats. The resulting high-frequency dataset is validated through statistical robustness checks and narrative analysis of index peaks. Our work contributes to the literature by offering a scalable, globally representative tool for analyzing geopolitical risk, complementing existing measurements such as the Caldara-Lacoviello GPR index and enabling new empirical applications in macroeconomics, finance and international relations.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Information and communication technology (ICT) has advanced significantly in the modern era, and the majority of smart technology utilized in smart cities are Internet of things (IoT) based. Hybrid passive optical networks (PON) consist of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) are of the most encouraging and widely utilized technologies in optical distribution networks (ODN) required for security, encryption data and bandwidth. The security of the mystery/private cryptographic key is crucial to the encryption process’s ability to secure data. Any strong encryption algorithm would be compromised by poor key management. In order to enhance the physical security, so as to protect the secret data during transmission across the channel and to ensure a secure exchange of the encryption key between the transmitter and the recipient, a hybrid system that incorporates cryptography, steganography, and key hiding techniques has been employed. To the best of our knowledge, Opti-System software with python devices combine to create a secure WDM/TDM-PON system depending on the Hill Group cipher and ITU-T G.989.2 standards. Simulation studies indicate that, a bidirectional fiber distance with a splitting ratio 1:64 and a symmetrical 40 Gbps can be accomplished successfully out at 60 km. The least amount of acceptable receiver sensitivity is −28.1 dBm for uplink (U/S) and −23.7 dBm for downlink (D/S).</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<hg:p>Christoph Schlingensief’s excursions beyond the theater are well known for their disruptions of public space (i.e., streets, theaters, art museums, churches, and shopping centers). This essay reorients the discussion of these projects, moving from a focus on public spaces to the social labor of ‘aesthetic commoning.’ Considering Passion Impossible (1997), Chance 2000 (1998), the African Edition of Schlingensief’s Animatograph (2005), his Operndorf and Via Intolleranza II (2010) as a network of activities rather than discrete projects draws attention to the publics who were part of Schlingensief’s performances outside of the theater and who (in some cases) continued them on their own terms. This article sheds light on the irresolvable tension between spontaneity and the quotidian that troubled Schlingensief’s projects in the long term, including his interventions in Africa: the immediacy of collective creativity emerges out of and is sustained by the ongoing labor of everyday commoning.</hg:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The advent of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has profoundly transformed quality management by integrating advanced digital technologies into traditional quality assurance and control systems. While the potential benefits of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0) are substantial, including increased efficiency, real-time monitoring, and predictive decision-making, its adoption poses significant challenges. These include high investment costs, workforce resistance, digital skill shortages, and difficulties integrating new tools with legacy quality systems. Many organizations lack a structured framework to assess their readiness and systematically progress toward digital maturity.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>To address these challenges, our research team developed the Q4.0 Capability Roadmap: a practical framework that supports organizations in their digital quality transformation. The roadmap presents a structured maturity model composed of six progressive levels, grouped into two stages—Readiness and Maturity—spanning operational, strategic, and cultural dimensions.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>This chapter presents both the conceptual foundation and empirical validation of the roadmap, drawing on case studies from three distinct organizations: a service provider (Company A), a textile manufacturer (Company B), and a tool manufacturer (Company C). These case studies illustrate varied paths to Q4.0 adoption, revealing common challenges, effective enablers, and best practices to support successful digital quality transformation across diverse industries.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The systematic literature review (SLR) presented in this study investigates the barriers and enablers of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0) implementation within organizations, categorizing these factors into technological, organizational, human, and regulatory dimensions. The analysis reveals significant challenges such as the integration of legacy systems, resistance to change, skills gaps, and regulatory complexities. Conversely, the study identifies key enablers including advanced data analytics, leadership commitment, workforce upskilling, and supportive regulatory frameworks. This research contributes to theory by consolidating fragmented insights on Q4.0 into a comprehensive framework that highlights the interconnectedness of various factors influencing its adoption. For practice, the study provides actionable strategies for overcoming barriers and leveraging enablers, offering guidance for organizations to effectively navigate the transition to Q4.0 and enhance their quality management systems in the context of Industry 4.0.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>A growing body of evidence reveals how EdTech is a vital apparatus of Big Tech’s ubiquitous web of surveillance and control bound to larger political, economic and cultural forces. Tech companies design platforms that inflict a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and developmental harms on children, and replace human relationships with technologies that cannot provide the authentic emotional and empathetic experiences that are essential for healthy development and well-being.  GenAI is fast becoming crucial infrastructure for education systems, despite its record for augmenting bigotry, generating false information and enabling cheating. Ultimately, EdTech prioritizes obedience and subverts critical literacy.  This book meticulously applies critical and cultural theory to analyze the discourse of industry narratives alongside counternarratives and hard evidence that expose EdTech’s role as a compulsory appendage of the exploitive and autocratic designs of the Big Data and AI ecosystem.  “As schools around the world hurtle towards wholesale embrace of more and more forms of EdTech, Timothy Scott flashes big bright red stoplights by not only debunking deceptive marketing but also illuminating the profoundly antidemocratic origins and dystopian futures of a wide range of technologies with breathtaking depth and breadth. Schooling for Silicon Valley is brilliant, eyeopening, compelling, and a must-read for anyone concerned about education, especially now.” —Kevin Kumashiro, Author of Surrendered: Why Progressives  are Losing the Biggest Battles in Education  “This provocative and timely volume offers an exceedingly well researched expose of the ways that technology companies are warping teaching and learning. As corporations falsely assert that tech can replace teachers and algorithms can replace meaningful curriculum, this book gives us our talking points for resisting tech giants and their government allies.” —Celia Oyler, Professor Emerita of Education,  Teachers College, Columbia University</jats:p>

Principal Component Analysis is then applied to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional features, constructing diagnostic feature vectors. Second, to overcome the limitation of traditional JDA methods, which use fixed weights for marginal and conditional distribution adaptation, a dynamic weight adjustment strategy is introduced. During the adaptation process, the strategy prioritizes the adaptation of marginal distributions in the early stages to alleviate the imbalance in target domain samples and subsequently focuses on conditional distribution adaptation to improve the classifier’s ability to distinguish fault categories in the target domain.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The results demonstrate that, under conditions of limited target domain samples, the proposed method achieves average diagnostic accuracies of 94.5 and 97.5% on two datasets, significantly outperforming traditional JDA methods and conventional classification approaches.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The improved JDA (IJDA) method is combined with a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for classification, and its effectiveness is validated using bearing experimental datasets.

  - 摘要：<bc:p>The article reads Christoph Schlingensief’s performance Bitte liebt Österreich (2000) as disclosing and critiquing a conundrum in the construction of human rights and exposing the biopolitical as a structural feature of the democratic dispositif and the classical public sphere. Schlingensief’s ethically ambivalent strategy of over-identification traces the substitution of deliberative political models with forms of gamification, thus illuminating the production of “bare life” in the context of late-stage capitalism. The article maintains that Schlingensief investigates the emerging attention economies and their subjectification techniques, exposing the ways in which affect produces and organizes identities and publics under neoliberalism.</bc:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The placement and realization of direct and indirect objects (henceforth DO and IO) in Kurmanji is subject to variation; e.g., DO and IO can be placed before or after one another in the preverbal domain; IO can be placed before the verb as an adpositional phrase, or, if recipient, it can be realized as a noun phrase (NP) after the verb. Although the postverbal variant has been the subject of a number of studies, the relative order between DO and IO in the preverbal domain has almost gone unnoticed. Taking a quantitative approach, in this study, first, we conducted a corpus study to observe the frequency of occurrences of IO in relation to the direct object and the verb, and to identify the potential factors that are involved in determining the choice of word order. Results indicated a clear preference for the DO-IO-V order. Definiteness of the DO, animacy of the IO, and the relative length between DO and IO are among the factors showing a meaningful effect. We next conducted a sentence production experiment to evaluate the effect of definiteness and animacy in a controlled manner. The results of our experimental study confirmed the effect of definiteness and animacy found in our corpus study. We further discuss the efficiency of each word order option in light of efficiency principles proposed by usage-based accounts of word order preferences.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Skin wound healing remains a significant clinical challenge, with traditional therapies often facing issues such as infection and secondary trauma. Thermoelectric (TE) materials possess the unique ability to convert thermal energy into electrical energy. Electrical signals generated by these materials can accelerate skin wound healing by reconstructing endogenous electric fields, modulating the inflammatory microenvironment, and promoting angiogenesis. Despite their substantial potential, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, biocompatibility, antimicrobial properties, and practical applications of TE materials in skin wound healing is still lacking. This review aims to highlight recent advancements in wound healing using TE materials, while integrating considerations of flexibility, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial performance to optimize TE device design. Strategies for enhancing thermoelectric performance, such as carrier concentration modulation, band engineering, and lattice thermal conductivity reduction, are discussed to balance conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. Although challenges in biosafety and room-temperature performance regulation of inorganic materials persist, future developments in multimodal synergistic therapy, intelligent monitoring systems, and novel material design are expected to drive the clinical translation of TE materials for treating refractory wounds.</jats:p>

The study intends to explore networked learning in the workplace (knowledge sharing and connection buildings) and gain insights into how workers develop connections through learning analytics social network analysis (SNA).</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>SNA was employed to explore how learning connections were established amongst healthcare workers in a large hospital in Singapore. We examined both the total network interactions (density, diameter, average shortest path length) and the levels of interactions between individuals (degree, betweenness, closeness centralities). A total of 99 responses were included in the final data analysis, and Python packages such as NetworkX were used to perform SNA.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The network as a whole is sparse, as indicated by the low-density score (0.4%). The findings of the study reveal that the bigger sub-networks had more than one worker who interacted with more than one co-worker and these tend to have more edges in them interlinking workers from different departments. We also found that workers from the departments with the larger populations in the sub-networks were more likely to have the highest degree, betweenness and closeness centrality values. This indicates that the larger sub-networks hold more value in terms of understanding how workers with higher centrality values are nurtured.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This paper sheds light on the learning process that occurs when workers engage in networked learning and provides empirical findings with Singapore as the context of the study.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

It explores whether religious screening creates genuine market separation or whether both sectors remain connected through information, liquidity and sentiment channels.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The analysis applies a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model to the FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Shariah Index (FBMS) and major listed sin stocks in alcohol, tobacco and gaming sectors. FBMS represents more than 70% of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The results indicate a moderate degree of integration between SC and sin equities. FBMS consistently transmits shocks to all sin stocks, reflecting its dominance in capturing systemic and policy-driven movements. Sin equities, however, occasionally emerge as transmitters during periods of strong firm performance or sectoral news, such as excise reforms or post-pandemic recovery, revealing short-term contagion reversals within the system.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This paper provides evidence on time-varying spillovers between SC and sin equities in an emerging dual-market context. It highlights that moral and ethical segmentation does not imply financial isolation, as systemic shocks and liquidity cycles influence both sides of the market.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>
