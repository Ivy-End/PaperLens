  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>                     The concept of ‘alignment’ has been commonly used to refer to the re-organizations of the world deemed necessary in order to accommodate the workings of complex technological systems. However, such re-organizations also, and inevitably, dis-organize the settings where such technologies are deployed. This, in turn, incites further orderings – and thus further dis-orderings. Complex (if often invisible) patterns of ‘articulation work’ typically emerge in order to handle such tensions. The article sets out to highlight the patterns of articulation work associated with the corporate ‘digital transformations’ and alignments enacted around Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) technologies in a multinational glass manufacturing company. Our investigation shows how technologically mediated order and disorder, organization and disorganization, are both opposed                     <jats:italic>and</jats:italic>                     parasitic upon one another.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Many aspects of our perception and behavior are influenced by prior knowledge. We are usually unaware of this influence, but every now and then we notice its effects, for example when you lift a mug you thought was still full of coffee, only to find that it is almost empty. Prior knowledge also affects our spatial perception. For example, when walking to a new destination, the return journey often feels different from the outward one, partly because on the way back we already have prior knowledge about the distance to be covered. This dissertation investigates how prior knowledge influences our vestibular perception of spatial orientation and self-motion. My research involved measuring participants in behavioral experiments and modeling the collected data using mathematical models. I conclude that vestibular perception is affected by prior knowledge about task-relevant stimulus history, accumulated over multiple timescales.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.1</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>                     International organizations (IOs) have inner and external environments with which they interact. In this paper, we follow up on this idea and add the notion that IOs also have environments that exist                     <jats:italic>in-between</jats:italic>                     the internal and external sphere. We focus on entities which take part in the IOs proceedings to some degree, but still remain on the boundaries of the organization. We assume that these                     <jats:italic>in-between</jats:italic>                     spaces can appear either in an informal manner or in formalized structures, and include various actors from the IO’s environment. The                     <jats:italic>in-betweens</jats:italic>                     are conceptualized as spaces where IOs and entities from their environment interact with each other more closely, for instance by incorporating external actors into the organizational procedures and blurring boundaries. By conceptualizing IOs as open systems, we explore the idea of                     <jats:italic>in-between</jats:italic>                     -environments and examine how they are constituted and what characterizes these spaces on the organizational boundaries of IOs. To explore the various manifestations and functions of the                     <jats:italic>in-between</jats:italic>                     -environments, we examine them in the context of the International Labour Organization and Arctic Council. We find that the constitution of the                     <jats:italic>in-between</jats:italic>                     depends on the IO’s institutional design, and is characterized by its degree of formality, by fragility and intentionality.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Rapidly advancing with innovations in AI, biotechnology, cybernetics, and neuroscience, human augmentation entails technological, biological, and genetic interventions. This chapter discusses the ethical dilemmas that human augmentation presents for the workplace, focusing on privacy and informed consent, workplace inequality among employees, and potential undue pressure to adopt any particular form of augmentation. Key technologies driving this process include AI cognitive assistants, gene editing, and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), which promise productivity and well-being for employees. Nevertheless, these come with considerable ethical concerns. Privacy offenses arise with employer access to employees’ biometric and neural information and thus require strong data protection policies. Workplace inequality may arise, especially with a distinction between enhanced employees and those without augmentation. The necessity of protecting autonomy by having augmentation be entirely voluntary, free of any sort of coercion, is worth emphasizing. The chapter will also analyze how global ethics guidelines from organizations such as UNESCO and WHO help regulate augmentation technologies and promote responsible infant development. With a culture of inclusion in which both augmented and non-augmented employees are afforded equal opportunity to prosper, organizations will realize the full measure of the benefit from augmentation while keeping a watchful eye on the protection of core human rights. To tackle these ethical challenges, an adequate response should find a good balance between promoting innovation and upholding human dignity so that the function of technology in human life is really an enhancement of life that does not diminish basic rights. Continued public dialog, ethical oversight, and adherence to global standards will be imperative in guiding human augmentation in the workplace.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Africa stands at a pivotal crossroads—marked by persistent socioeconomic inequalities, environmental fragility, and complex development challenges, yet also rich in cultural assets, indigenous knowledge, and youth-driven creativity. Despite impressive economic growth in recent decades, the benefits of development have remained unevenly distributed, often excluding the very populations most in need. Conventional models of innovation have failed to address the continent’s unique sociocultural, ecological, and institutional realities.  This groundbreaking book offers a radical rethinking of innovation as a driver of inclusive and sustainable transformation in Africa. It explores how innovation can be reimagined not solely as a vehicle for economic growth, but as a catalyst for social equity, environmental resilience, and community empowerment.  Through case studies, theoretical contributions, strategic frameworks, and actionable toolkits, the book challenges traditional hierarchies of knowledge and power, proposing a pluralistic, participatory, and justice-oriented innovation paradigm aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).It inspires a new generation of African innovation leaders committed to systemic change, ethical leadership, and sustainable development grounded in equity, dignity, and collective well-being.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Wearable technology in human resource management (HRM) has brought about significant changes in the monitoring, support, and improvement of employees’ well-being at the workplace. This chapter examines the opportunity that e-HRM offers in enhancing wellness and performance of employees through wearable technology. With help of tracking health status, stress levels, and organization of individual health improving programs, companies can create conditions in workplace which also reflect concern for the health of an employee. With reference to the roles of wearable devices in the dynamic changes of the working world, such insights help the intended audiences, including HR practitioners, future researchers, and government policymakers, to develop a better understanding of the multifaceted implications of technology health and employee performance in the 21st century.</jats:p>

On the other hand, their evaluations often imply preferences for Western or “progressive” standards, suggesting a desire to reshape the local experience through an external cultural lens. The study concludes that while Rahat is portrayed as a site of unique hospitality and desert charm, the digital mediation simultaneously reproduces Orientalist assumptions and implicit biases toward Bedouin society.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This research offers a novel perspective on digital mediation as a bottom-up communicative practice that uncovers latent power relations and sociocultural hierarchies.

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Perkembangan kecerdasan buatan (Artificial Intelligence/AI) menghadirkan peluang sekaligus ancaman baru dalam ranah sosial, termasuk dalam bentuk kekerasan dalam rumah tangga (KDRT). Fenomena penyalahgunaan AI, seperti penggunaan stalkerware untuk pengawasan, pembuatan deepfake untuk pemerasan, hingga gaslighting berbasis chatbot, memperlihatkan munculnya pola kekerasan digital yang semakin kompleks. Namun, sistem hukum Indonesia belum sepenuhnya mampu mengantisipasi fenomena ini karena terdapat kekosongan norma dalam Undang-Undang Penghapusan Kekerasan dalam Rumah Tangga (UU PKDRT) dan keterbatasan penerapan Undang-Undang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik (UU ITE) dalam ranah domestik. Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis urgensi penguatan sistem hukum terhadap penyalahgunaan AI dalam KDRT melalui perspektif kriminologi. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah pendekatan yuridis normatif dengan dukungan data empiris melalui kajian literatur, analisis peraturan perundang-undangan, serta studi kasus fenomena penyalahgunaan teknologi dalam KDRT. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa (1) terdapat kekosongan hukum yang melemahkan perlindungan korban; (2) kendala penegakan hukum meliputi lemahnya standar pembuktian digital, keterbatasan kapasitas aparat, dan dominasi budaya patriarkal; serta (3) perspektif kriminologi, khususnya teori kontrol koersif dan kriminologi feminis, memperlihatkan bahwa AI berfungsi sebagai instrumen dominasi patriarkal dalam relasi domestik. Penelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa penguatan sistem hukum diperlukan melalui pembaruan regulasi, harmonisasi dengan UU terkait, penyusunan pedoman pembuktian digital, pembentukan unit forensik digital, serta peningkatan literasi hukum aparat dan masyarakat. Dengan pendekatan hukum responsif dan progresif, diharapkan perlindungan korban KDRT berbasis AI dapat terjamin secara lebih efektif.</jats:p>

In doing so, this study provides insights into the influence replacement narratives have on AI use, showing that AI imaginaries can be understood as social practice imaginaries emerging from the present.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The study is based on 20 interviews with HRM practitioners in Italy and two organizational observations with companies using AI in the recruitment process. The use of interviews and observations together has allowed to gather information about both HR practitioners’ expectations and emerging practices.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The results show that HR practitioners negotiate replacement narratives against the backdrop of their own experience in using AI. Learning is adopted as a strategy to protect themselves from replacement, while popular fears and hopes are delayed as the current AI capabilities do not fulfill their promises. AI becomes a useful tool allowing them to dedicate themselves to meaningful tasks contributing to their self-actualization. From these emerging practices stems an alternative imaginary of AI, positioning workers’ wellbeing at the center of automation.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study challenges narratives on the future of AI for work by providing empirical evidence of their negotiation by workers and intersecting them with research on social practices. By doing so, it proposes an alternative imaginary of the future of AI in the workplace that moves away from traditional expectations about replacement and invites reflection on workers’ needs.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

In doing so, the study addresses the fragmentation in current conceptualisations of HSC resilience.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>A contextualised literature review systematically analysing a corpus of 89 peer-reviewed articles, guided by a S–E resilience framework, was employed to identify key actions, barriers and applied resilience principles in the HSC context.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Key S–E resilience elements, such as collaboration, flexibility and agility, are already present in the HSC resilience literature. Actions enhancing HSC resilience were identified and categorised by implementation phase and enabled S–E resilience capability. Most resilience actions align with persistence and adaptation; only a few cases of transformative resilience are documented. The identification of contextual factors, such as regulatory rigidity, resource constraints and fragmentation, hindering adaptation and transformation, as well as progress towards a desirable post-disturbance state, is another key finding of this study.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Social implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Enhancing these capabilities improves the system's ability to withstand and recover from disturbances, ensuring continuous access to healthcare services, and allows the HSC to transform, exploiting disturbances as opportunities to evolve to a new, better post-disturbance state. Such transformation can lead to more equitable healthcare delivery, reduce vulnerabilities and improve long-term outcomes.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study examines HSC resilience through the lens of S–E resilience, which emphasises transformation to a stronger state after disturbances rather than merely restoring stability, overcoming the engineering resilience conceptualisation.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>
