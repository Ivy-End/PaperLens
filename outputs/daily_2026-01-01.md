  - 摘要：<jats:p>Neurons in higher-order visual areas integrate information through a canonical computation called normalization. The strength of normalization is highly heterogeneous across neurons, and this heterogeneity correlates with attention-mediated modulations in neural responses. However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneous normalization strength is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. Our model reveals that the heterogeneity of normalization strength is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. The correlation between inhibition and other synaptic inputs explains the experimentally observed dependence of spike count correlations on normalization strength. Further, we find that neurons with stronger normalization encode information more efficiently, and that networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode visual stimuli with higher information and capacity. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex and sheds light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Both geometric changes and new technologies are being implemented throughout the United States with the potential to significantly improve the operational capabilities and safety of underperforming corridors. Despite the potential upsides, there are significant up-front costs that can prohibit the widespread adoption of new technologies. This research explores the use of anonymous probe vehicle (APV) speed data and crash data to visualise and rank intersection performance. A methodology was created to produce visually intuitive performance metrics to highlight underperforming road segments. Spearman’s rank correlation (SRC) is utilised to determine road segments with a significant correlation between the observed congestion and the number of crashes, using 360 million APV speed records and 12 000 crash records along a 32 mile (51.5 km) segment of US Route 1 in New Jersey, USA. The study proposes a methodology to analyse the corridor response to crash incidents using vectors to visualise changes in speeds around an incident. With the new visualisation technique and SRC, capital improvement decisions are supported by data-driven funding allocation methods.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The health dynamics in older adults, influenced by age-related changes, frailty and chronic disease risks, necessitate comprehensive research. However, the limited participation of older adults in health studies challenges evidence-based practice. This paper addresses methodological challenges related to advanced age and provides practical advice for conducting research with older adults. Strategies involve careful instrument selection and accommodation of responder fatigue. Vision and hearing impairments require adapted questionnaire formats, visual aids, and optimal communication. Medication-related challenges and cognitive impairment requires thoughtful data collection approaches. Electronic health records and national clinical quality registries are proposed as promising data sources in research on older adults.</jats:p>

They are novel, two-terminal and passive elements, having very good commutating and memory features. For design, synthesis and analysis of memristor circuits, scientists need simple, precise and fast-operating memristor models and suitable software. The purpose of this paper is to provide simplified and quickly functioning memristor models, paying attention on basic parasitic parameters – capacitance, resistance, inductance, additional small-signal DC current and voltage sources for shifting the i–v relations, and analysis of their influence on memristor operation. Models’ simplification ensures analyses of complex memristor-based devices.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The optimal values of memristor model’s coefficients and parasitic parameters are estimated, applying experimental voltage–current characteristics of Knowm memristors and using a gradient-descending technique in Simulink-MATLAB.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Analyses in MATLAB and LTSPICE approve the correct and fast operation of proposed memristor models, their good memory and switching properties and applicability in different electronic devices.

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This chapter examines the central role of peer support in promoting migrant wellbeing, inclusion, and innovation in contemporary workplaces. While formal diversity policies often emphasise representation and compliance, they frequently overlook the relational dynamics that shape how inclusion is lived. Peer support, including informal mentoring, collegial bonds, and interpersonal validation, emerges as a powerful yet underutilised mechanism through which migrant professionals can build psychological safety, confidence, and belonging. Drawing on interdisciplinary literature, the chapter shows that peer relationships are not mere niceties but key enablers of adaptation, creativity, and collaboration. It analyses peer support models such as buddy systems, informal mentorship, affinity groups, and cross-cultural circles, and examines the leadership and organisational conditions that allow them to thrive. It calls for peer support to be recognised as core infrastructure: embedded, resourced, and modelled across organisations to unlock migrant talent and build truly inclusive cultures.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Direct lineage reprogramming of glial cells to induced neurons has the potential for restoring brain circuits and function in neuronal disorders and states. We introduce three-dimensional (3D) human glia reprogramming into neurons with a GABAergic interneuron phenotype using stem cell–derived human glia. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the converted cells demonstrates distinct neuronal clusters within 2 weeks, including a parvalbumin (PV) cluster with high neuronal maturity and features of chandelier interneurons. A lineage trajectory analysis of the glia-to-neuron conversion reveals a distinct lineage pathway to PV chandelier fate, including various neuronal developmental stages and the establishment of synaptic machinery. This analysis reveals PV fate-important genes that are previously unknown to neural reprogramming with promising functional importance for future derivations. Our data demonstrate successful human glia conversion into interneurons with features of bona fide PV subtype and highlight the reprogramming trajectory with key transitional genes. This advancement holds promise for future human brain cell engineering and repair.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Companies actively use interactive training materials in electronic format in corporate training to help employees acquire new knowledge, skills and abilities. Various formats of electronic courses, from presentations and educational screenshots to interactive videos, help not only to reduce the number of errors, but also to reduce training costs. However, quite often courses are presented with a large number of “small pieces” of content, often without disciplinary connections and sound technology for the formation and development of professional competencies. As a result, the fundamental principles of the continuous education system are blurred, acquiring at best intuitive, and often flawed forms, dressed in newfangled trends. Based on scientific research and practical experience in implementing additional educational programs for corporate customers, the authors identified organizational and methodological conditions and proposed models, methods and methodological tools for designing and implementing personalized training programs through corporate HCI in ate training.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The medical response to major incidents has recently seen encouraging developments within the UK. However, the role of independent ambulance services and event medical services appears to have been largely ignored. Part 1 of this two-part article lays the foundations of a critical narrative review that aims to identify, collect and synthesise literature surrounding the role and significance of event medical services at major incidents. This is achieved by using an open hybrid methodology in which both SANRA and PRISMA are employed. The results of this methodological approach will be recorded, analysed and discussed in part 2, which will highlight the overlooked significance of event medical services.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Global migration, involving over 304 million people and remittances exceeding $860 billion by mid-2024, is a key driver of twenty-first-century transformation. Beyond economics, migration fosters social innovation, resilience, and sustainable development. Migrants act as change agents by mobilizing financial, social, and institutional capital through remittances, diaspora investments, skills transfer, and leadership. Integrating migration theories, social entrepreneurship, and resilience frameworks, this chapter highlights how migrant-led initiatives in Europe, South Asia, and East Africa enhance empowerment, cohesion, and local capacity. Policy priorities include inclusive finance, simplified regulation, credential recognition, mentorship networks, and public-private partnerships to harness migration's transformative potential.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>When studying policy-relevant topics, researchers’ policy preferences may shape analytical decisions and results interpretations. Detecting this bias is challenging because the research process is not normally part of an observed experimental setting. Our study exploits an opportunity to observe 158 researchers working independently in 71 teams during an experiment. After being asked their position on immigration policy, they used the same data to answer the same empirical question: Does immigration affect public support for social welfare programs? The researchers estimated 1253 alternative regression models, and the estimated impacts ranged from strongly negative to strongly positive. We find that teams composed of pro-immigration researchers estimated more positive impacts of immigration on public support for social programs, while anti-immigration teams estimated more negative impacts. The differences arise because different teams adopted different model specifications. The underlying research design decisions are the mechanism through which ideology enters the process of producing parameter estimates.</jats:p>
