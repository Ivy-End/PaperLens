  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Photodetectors can convert light energy into electrical signals, so are widely used in photovoltaics, photon counting, monitoring, and imaging. Photodetectors are easy to prepare high-resolution photochips because of their small size unit integration. However, these photodetector units often exhibit poor photoelectric performance due to material defects and inadequate structures, which greatly limit the functions of devices. Designing modification strategies and micro-/nanostructures can compensate for defects, adjust the bandgap, and develop novel quantum structures, which consequently optimize photovoltaic units and revolutionize optoelectronic devices. Here, this paper aims to comprehensively elaborate on the surface/interface engineering scheme of micro-/nano-photodetectors. It starts from the fundamentals of photodetectors, such as principles, types, and parameters, and describes the influence of material selection, manufacturing techniques, and post-processing. Then, we analyse in detail the great influence of surface/interface engineering on the performance of photovoltaic devices, including surface/interface modification and micro-/nanostructural design. Finally, the applications and prospects of optoelectronic devices in various fields such as miniaturization of electronic devices, robotics, and human–computer interaction are shown.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p xml:lang="en">Increased instalment of power electronic devices and alternative energy sources to grids leads to increase in power quality problems representing a threat to power-sensitive loads and electronically controlled equipment.  Dealing with power quality problems is an important concern viewed from life-cycle of equipment and facilitating a stable manufacturing process in industrial plants. Accurate examination of anomalies in power quality in real-time is required to decide which preventive measure to take. There are numerous studies employing machine learning and optimization methods to detect and classify the power quality events in literature. However, only a few dwell on real-time performance of proposed approaches. This study presents a closed-loop approach based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network model to capture power quality events in time domain requiring no human intervention from training to inference. An application, accompanied by a data acquisition tool, is developed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach using the Tensorflow C++ library. The application is ported to Raspberry Pi 5 and Jetson Orin Nano single board computers to reveal the embedded system performance of the presented system.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>In dense environments, it is challenging for multiple pursuers to capture an evader with an uncertain strategy. When the pursuers start from arbitrary initial positions rather than being evenly distributed around the evader, it becomes even more difficult for them to quickly approach and successfully coordinate to encircle the evader. To address this issue, we present a novel hierarchical framework to address the problem of multi-pursuer evader-approaching and encirclement in dense environments without any initial position constraint. At the high level, a novel task assignment method based on Dynamic Reallocate Review Consensus (DRRC) is proposed to reduce the intersecting paths and further resolve allocation conflicts. At the low level, an effective distributed motion planning algorithm based on Follow-the-Optimal-Gap Method (FOGM) is proposed, integrating adaptive safety factor and optimal reciprocal collision avoidance for the multi-pursuer collision-free trajectories, guaranteeing that multi-pursuer can efficiently and safely encircle and capture the evader. Extensive simulation experiments in different hunting scenarios and two real-world experiments validate the applicability and practicability of our methods.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study examines the impact and influence of semantics and syntax on Philippine online news headlines. From 2010 to 2025, findings show that news outlets increasingly adopted diverse headline styles to appeal to specific audiences, reflecting shifts in cultural, social, and political contexts. ABS-CBN emphasized cultural identity and national unity, while The Philippine Star frequently used irony to highlight societal issues. The Philippine Daily Inquirer catered to a more informed readership through complex language, whereas the Manila Bulletin prioritized clarity and simplicity for broader accessibility. Across platforms, dominant syntactic features included brevity, concise sentence structures, and the use of active voice to ensure immediacy and impact. Semantically, headlines commonly employed rhetorical devices, emotional appeal, and culturally relevant terms to enhance reader engagement. Overall, Philippine online headlines evolved significantly during the 15-year period, adapting linguistic choices to audience preferences and societal changes while retaining their core function of providing clear, compelling information.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study explores the construction of virtual identity in the animated film Colorful Stage! A Miku Who Can’t Sing (2025) through Roland Barthes’ semiotic framework. Using a qualitative approach, the analysis focuses on selected visual and auditory signs, including stage design, avatar customization, audience responses, and glitch effects. Each sign is examined at the levels of denotation and connotation, followed by the identification of myths that naturalize particular understandings of digital identity. The findings demonstrate that the film portrays virtual identity as both aspirational and vulnerable: aspirational through the myth of perfection, where avatars appear flawless and empowering, and vulnerable through scenes that reveal emotional fragility and technological disruptions. This duality reflects broader cultural narratives about authenticity, social validation, and the tension between real and virtual selves. By situating the analysis within media semiotics and digital culture, the study highlights how Colorful Stage functions as a cultural text that mirrors contemporary discourses on identity in mediated environments.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>This chapter examines the challenges autistic students face in secondary school as they navigate complex academics and social interactions. It explains how balancing schoolwork and social expectations requires significant cognitive effort, often necessitating tailored support from educators and caregivers. The chapter explores cognitive fluctuations among autistic students, emphasizing that intelligence quotient scores can change over time and should not solely determine educational placement or support. It explains how school accommodations, including Individualized Education Programs and 504 plans, ensure equitable access to education and adapt to students’ evolving needs. Finally, the chapter promotes a strengths-based approach that values autistic students’ unique abilities, encourages structured support, and fosters self-advocacy in inclusive environments.</jats:p>

- **Comparative communication of health and hygiene awareness guides in Senegal: Dynamics and field realities**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This article takes a close look at public health and cleanliness awareness campaigns in Senegal, unpacking how they’re shaped by local social representations and the persuasive communication techniques used by planners. The core question on the table: how effective are these guides—these campaigns, pamphlets, school programs, even cheeky SMS messages—at actually combating health threats like cholera and malaria, especially in the messiness of real-world cultural habits and beliefs? Methodologically, it is pretty robust—think: a “mixed-methods” approach, meaning the researcher didn’t just pluck stats from a spreadsheet. They got hands-on, analysing campaign content, running in-depth interviews, and even staking out actual initiatives to observe how people react in the wild. The analysis zeroes in on five significant Senegalese health efforts, such as “Marché Santé” (market-based health initiatives), “Écoles Santé” (school interventions), and the adrenaline-fueled Ebola SMS campaigns that bombarded communities during outbreaks. What did they find, as they combed through the data? Well, it’s not one-size-fits-all. Strategies ranged from top-down, didactic “here’s what you should do” messages, to more participatory, community-driven, and educational models. Interestingly, the notion of “cleanliness” itself turned out to be a hotbed of conflicting ideas—sometimes it’s framed in technical, almost clinical terms (use this soap, follow this routine), while elsewhere it’s enmeshed in the rhythms and traditions of local life (rituals, beliefs, even superstitions). The upshot of all this? If health guides are going to make real inroads, designers can’t just parachute in with generic solutions. Successful communication needs to be rooted in the everyday lives and cultural frameworks of specific communities. The article recommends, ultimately, that developers tailor health messaging more thoughtfully, integrating local practices and addressing the unique needs of each group. Only then is there any real hope of boosting health literacy and genuinely shifting everyday behaviours.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p xml:lang="en">Factors such as globalization, economic and political instability, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks directly affect the tourism sector, and perceptions of security are key determinants of tourist preferences. Despite its rich natural and cultural assets, Şırnak, located in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, has not fully realized its tourism potential due to past security problems. Following the implementation of recent security measures, tourism activity in the region has experienced a noticeable resurgence, accompanied by an increase in visitor numbers. Therefore, this research aims to examine the effects of visitors’ perceptions of crime and security in Şırnak on their satisfaction, intention to revisit, and intention to recommend. A quantitative research method was adopted, and a survey was administered to 402 participants selected via simple random sampling between March 1 and April 23, 2024. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, explanatory factor analysis (EFA), correlation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation model (SEM). Research findings reveal that visitors’ positive perceptions of crime and security in Şırnak positively affect satisfaction, revisits, and recommendation intentions. In addition, it has been determined that visitor satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between crime and security perception and revisit and recommendation intentions.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This paper presents the nanofabrication of transparent, mechano-bactericidal surfaces using Inverted Glancing Angle Deposition (I-GLAD). Inspired by natural antimicrobial mechanisms, the fabricated surfaces feature needlelike nanostructures that physically rupture microbial cells upon contact, thereby offering a passive method of microbial elimination and reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Despite their promise, replicating such mechano-bactericidal surfaces artificially—particularly on transparent materials—remains challenging due to the complexity of the required three-dimensional nanostructures. Leveraging the I-GLAD technique, an advanced form of physical vapor deposition, this study successfully fabricates large-area surfaces with nanoneedles featuring sub-10 nm tip sizes. The paper explores the critical process parameters for inversion, emphasizing the necessity of a deposition incident angle exceeding 79 deg, as validated through tape adhesion testing. Additionally, the integration of transparent materials into the I-GLAD process enables the creation of optically clear antimicrobial films. Optical transmittance and bacterial viability tests confirm the dual functionality of these surfaces. The transparent I-GLAD antimicrobial coatings hold significant potential for applications in healthcare, consumer electronics, and other daily-use environments requiring both visibility and sterility.</jats:p>
