  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The rapid expansion of malicious websites poses a critical threat to online security, as conventional blacklist-based and manual inspection methods cannot keep pace with evolving attacks. In this study, we present a hybrid detection framework that integrates ensemble learning models, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting with a Deep Neural Network to distinguish malicious from benign websites accurately. The framework leverages a large-scale dataset of 63,191 URLs, combining application-layer attributes (such as URL structure, server type, and WHOIS data) with network-layer features (including TCP exchanges, DNS queries, and packet statistics). Dimensionality reduction is achieved through Principal Component Analysis, while model explainability is provided by SHapley Additive exPlanations. To enhance predictive performance, hyperparameters are tuned using two recent metaheuristic algorithms: the Weevil Damage Optimization Algorithm and the Energy Valley Optimizer. A rigorous k-fold cross-validation strategy confirms the robustness and generalization capability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized hybrid framework surpasses individual classifiers, delivering high accuracy, strong scalability, and interpretability. This work contributes to proactive cybersecurity defenses by offering a reliable, data-driven, and explainable solution for real-time malicious website detection.</jats:p>

To identify the location of tumor, various methods based on image reconstruction have been developed. However, due to the complexity of the detected object and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, accurate image reconstruction is a great challenge. As a result, image-based identification accuracy raises a concern and a new method is required.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This paper develops an intelligent identification method that combines variational mode decomposition (VMD), convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network. The measured signal is decomposed by VMD, and features of the optimal decomposed component are extracted. The extracted features are then input into a network model for identifying different cases. The identification results of the proposed method are compared with other six methods under the noiseless condition. Moreover, various factors including the effects of noise interference, conductivity variation and contact impedance change on the proposed method are analyzed.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows the best identification accuracy. In contrast to the comparison methods, it is less sensitive to noise interference, conductivity variation and contact impedance change in identifying different cases.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The identification of tumor is implemented by direct analysis of boundary measurement. There is no need to solve the ill-posed inverse problem that is required in the traditional image-based identification approaches. A new choice for locating tumor with the lung EIT is provided.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Lecanemab, with accelerated approval from the FDA, becomes a notable and promising drug to fight against Alzheimer's disease (AD). As one monoclonal antibody, it is reported that lecanemab can reduce cognitive decline caused by AD by reducing amyloid-beta in patients. However, some concerns, uncertainties and limitations of Lecanemab in clinical trials have also been brought out. This study analyses the existing methods to cure AD and researches in clinical phases of lecanemab and relevant detailed information. This article aims to provide a relevant view of key aspects of lecanemab’s performance, including its mechanisms, effects, safety, limitations and tips. Thus, this study shows an updated summary for those who want to be exposed to the current situations of applications of Lecanemab. The nature of AD remains complex to us nowadays, so further fundamental research concerning the causes and mechanisms of AD. For those drugs targeting AD, many aspects involving itself and its usage still need to be investigated.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have emerged as a flexible and cost-effective networking solution for applications such as community broadband, disaster recovery, and smart infrastructure; however, their performance is highly influenced by the roles played by different node types within the network. Despite extensive research on WMN routing and architectures, node-specific performance comparisons remain limited, particularly under identical network conditions. To address this gap, this paper presents a comparative performance analysis of Access Nodes (APs), Relay Nodes (RNs), and Mobile Nodes (MNs) in WMNs. The study is conducted using the NS-3 network simulator, enabling a controlled and reproducible simulation-based evaluation. The performance of AP-, RN-, and MN-centric WMN deployments is analyzed under varying node densities and mobility scenarios. Key performance metrics considered include throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and energy efficiency, which collectively capture both communication quality and resource utilization. Simulation results reveal that AP-based architectures achieve the highest throughput, with improvements of approximately 20–25% compared to MN-dominated scenarios. RN-based deployments demonstrate superior reliability, improving PDR by nearly 15% in multi-hop environments, albeit at the cost of increased energy consumption. In contrast, MN-centric networks experience up to 30% higher delay and noticeable PDR degradation due to frequent topology changes caused by mobility. These findings highlight the critical impact of node roles on WMN performance and underscore the importance of node-aware design and routing strategies. The results provide practical insights for optimizing WMN deployment in mobility-intensive and resource-constrained environments</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study explores the integration of the pedagogical Deep Learning (DL) approach, specifically the Meaningful, Mindful, and Joyful (MMJ) framework, within the traditional educational system of Indonesian pesantren. The aim is to analyze the compatibility, challenges, and operationalization of DL to enhance learning outcomes and prepare students for the demands of the digital era. A qualitative case study approach was employed at pesantren Darunnajah in Bogor, involving in-depth interviews with 12 participants (3 teachers, 6 students, and 3 administrators), observations, and document analysis. The findings highlight a strong theoretical alignment between DL and pesantren's core educational values, such as Fahm (deep comprehension), Ijtihad (critical reasoning), and Adab (moral development). Empirically, teachers reported improved student engagement and reflective learning practices, with one educator noting, "The MMJ framework helps students connect religious lessons to their daily lives, making learning more relevant." However, the study identifies key challenges, including infrastructure gaps, diverse levels of digital literacy, and the need to balance digital innovation with the preservation of moral guidance. Strategies such as blended learning models and focused teacher training are recommended. The integration of DL within pesantren represents a strategic pedagogical evolution, empowering students to develop both religious and modern competencies. Future research should focus on the longitudinal impacts of DL on student outcomes.</jats:p>

Physician coding of VAs focused on the narrative of deaths and past symptoms is current best practice. Large language models (LLM) such as GPT-5 enable possible use of the narrative portion of VAs to assign CODs. However, there are few if any robust comparisons of LLMs to physician coding.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>                     <jats:p>We analyzed 6,939 VA records from a random sample of deaths in Sierra Leone (2019–2022) to compare five models: three LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-5) and two based on symptom algorithms (InterVA-5, InSilicoVA), against physician-assigned CODs. GPT models used narratives, whereas InterVA-5 and InSilicoVA relied on questionnaires. CODs were grouped into 19, 10, and 7 categories for adult, child, and neonatal deaths. We used cause specific mortality fraction (CSMF) accuracy and partial chance corrected concordance (PCCC) to assess population and individual-level agreement respectively, compared to the standard of physician coding.

- **Analysis of Cloud Service Provider’s Performance of User Service Experience and Cloud Service Level Agreement**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) promise high reliability through Service Level Agreements (SLAs), often guaranteeing availability levels of 99% and above. However, real-world cloud environments frequently fail to meet these commitments due to unexpected downtime, performance fluctuations, and infrastructure limitations. Existing SLA monitoring and blockchain-based frameworks primarily detect violations after they occur, offering limited support for predicting failures before they impact users. This creates a significant gap for organizations that rely on proactive decision-making to avoid service disruptions. To address this gap, this study develops a regression-based predictive model that estimates cloud service availability using key performance indicators such as downtime, trust scores, service regions, service diversity, and operational performance metrics. Results show that downtime alone explains approximately 69% of the variance in SLA availability, confirming its dominant influence on cloud reliability. When additional predictors are included, the accuracy of the multiple regression model increases to nearly 82%, demonstrating the advantage of a multi-factor predictive approach. This work provides a practical, data-driven framework that helps cloud consumers anticipate SLA performance more accurately, compare CSPs objectively, and make informed, proactive decisions before service failures occur. The findings contribute to improving transparency, reliability forecasting, and trust in cloud service ecosystems..</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p xml:lang="tr">Sinema teknik olarak gerçeğin basitçe yeniden üretilme ya da düşünsel bir yargının eksiksizce nihayete erdirilme çabası değildir. Tam tersine algıladığımız dünyaya dair gerçekliğin ancak ve ancak mesafeli bir kopyası, yaratıcı bir düşüncenin özgün bir tezahürüdür. Bu açıdan kendi söylemini, akışını ve görsel-işitsel tasarılarını ortaya koyarken, ‘film-dünyanın’ müstakil varoluşuna ancak kendine has görsel-işitsel ekipmanlarını dolaysızca çalıştırarak ulaşabilmektedir. Sinema bu potansiyeli ile başlı başına, gri gölgeler, çarpık yansımalar ve gelişi güzel belirip sonra kaybolan bulanık temaslarla örülü dünya imleyenlerinin, henüz ele geçirilmemiş duyular-arası deneyiminin çeşitli izdüşümlerini kendi suretinde, muhtelif biçemlerinde yeniden yaratabilme gücüne sahiptir. O halde, sinemayı teknik olanakları ve estetik varoluşu bakımından algımızda ifade bulan ve türlü tasarılarla iç içe geçmiş zihinsel ve bedensel deneyimlerin, tatbik edilme ve görsel-işitsel izahlarının fenomenolojik bir sunumla yeniden canlandırılma süreçleri olarak düşünmemiz yerinde olacaktır. Bu çalışma, film fenomenolojisi izleğini takip ederek, Laura U. Marks’ın haptik (dokunsal) görsel ve işitsel imgeler kavramsallaştırmasından yola çıkmaktadır. Haptik ses ve görüntü olarak kavramsallaştırılan bu imgeler aracılığıyla, sinemada dokunsal/bedensel deneyimin olası duyular ya da duyumlar-arası bir belleği nasıl aktive ettiği, Marguerite Duras’ın India Song (Hindistan Şarkısı, Marguerite Duras, 1975) filmi üzerinden analiz edilmektedir. Film fenomenolojisi hattını takip eden bu çalışma, söz konusu filmin haptik estetik olanaklarına odaklanmakta ve India Song’da ses ile görüntünün sinematografik serimlenişi esnasında ortaya çıkan ayrıksı karşılaşmaların, izleyicinin alışıldık algısal yerleşikliğini kesintiye uğratarak haptik duyumsamanın estetik koşullarını nasıl açığa çıkardığını tartışmaktadır.</jats:p>

It investigates how these language styles interact with presenter type (digital vs human), interpreter expertise (novice vs expert) and historical experience orientation (recreational vs educational) to influence tourist responses.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Three scenario-based experiments were conducted with American and Chinese participants respectively. Study 1 (n = 207) tested the interaction between language style and presenter type in a museum context. Study 2 (n = 220) explored the moderating role of interpreter expertise in a historical exhibit setting. Study 3 (n = 249) examined how historical experience orientation shapes language effectiveness. Mediation analyses assessed the roles of language typicality and authenticity.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Figurative language enhances tourist responses (e.g. visit intentions, attitudes) when used by digital presenters, whereas literal language is more effective with human presenters; contrary to predictions derived from the Language Expectancy Theory (LET), novice interpreters benefit from figurative language, while experts are more effective with literal language; Recreational experiences are more compelling with figurative language, whereas educational experiences favor literal language; language typicality and perceived authenticity serially mediate these effects in Study 1 and 3, but the sequential mediation exists only for novice but not expert presenters as shown in Study 2.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Theoretically, this study extends LET by revealing divergent language expectations for human versus digital communicators; challenges LET’s assumption of preexisting norms by showing that ambiguous norms in reality could cause different responses from those based on a priori norm; and demonstrates that authenticity can be constructed by language typicality. Practically, this research empowers tourism professionals to strategically adapt language styles to context, speaker type and experience orientation.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>
