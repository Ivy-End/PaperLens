  - 摘要：<jats:p>In embedded environments, large model code generation faces a series of issues such as high response latency, memory overflow, and poor adaptability of gen-erated code due to limited computing power and tight memory resources. To address these problems, this paper proposes an improved RAG architecture (EmbedCode-RAG) based on fine-grained compression and dual-dimensional retrieval. Firstly, the architecture utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-guided code snippet segmentation and lightweight block embedding compression technology to reduce the volume of reference code by 16-32 times. Subsequent-ly, a "task-situation" dual-dimensional retrieval mechanism is designed to inte-grate code function similarity and embedded hardware constraint features. Fi-nally, a dynamic knowledge base update module is incorporated to achieve pro-gressive accumulation of generation experience. We conducted experiments on two hardware platforms: ARM Cortex-M7 and NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The dataset used is a self-constructed embedded code corpus, including MCU drivers, IoT protocols, and other related tasks. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional RAG method, EmbedCode-RAG achieves an 8.3% improve-ment in the CodeBLEU score of generated code [20], reduces the Time to First Token (TTFT) by 82.6%, and decreases memory usage by 79.2%. Furthermore, the proposed method operates without crashes on low-power hardware. This research provides a new solution for realizing efficient and reliable code gener-ation in embedded scenarios.</jats:p>

- **Selective funnelling and state-space expansion: a conceptual framework for novelty generation and origin events**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Evolution, conceived broadly as encompassing both biological and abiological systems, generates novel structures and phenomena that are seemingly different, in important ways, from what came before. While it is always possible, in theory, to describe complex systems using the language of the most basic physical entities and laws, it is almost never practical to do so. When novel systems arise, their behaviour may be better explained and predicted using new sets of properties and principles. How can we understand this universal aspect of evolution—that is, the tendency of a system to produce astonishing novelty? Here, we introduce two new concepts: selective funnelling and state-space expansion. Together, these processes describe the mechanisms by which an evolving system shifts from one functional fitness landscape to another. During selective funnelling, non-equilibrium features from the previous level are ‘locked in’, promoting the increase of functional information in evolving systems with time. A state-space expansion event is characterized by significant changes in components of relevance, driving forces for exploring combinatorial possibilities and/or selection mechanisms. Together, selective funnelling and state-space expansion provide an abstract framework for understanding a plethora of diverse origin events, trends of increasing ‘complexity’ in the universe and the challenging phenomenon of ‘emergence’.</jats:p>

- **Virtual History. Perspectives on an Expanded Concept of History**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>We call “virtual history” a history that goes beyond past events to include possible yet unrealized courses of events. Some are eventually perceived as illusions, while others are revived when the conditions of their former emergence are recognized in the present again. Unlike counterfactual historiography, virtual historiography does not take its starting point from the present but from the expectations of contemporaries who designed a future for themselves. A chronological virtual history would consist of several parallel histories that are sometimes recognized as realistic representations of the past and sometimes rejected as unrealistic. However, other possible representations are also conceivable. To expand its representation of past realities, virtual historiography draws on new sources and disciplines. It interprets historical dates and time intervals as bridges between events and documents the time figures in which events align to form historical processes.</jats:p>

- **High-order expansion of neural ordinary differential equation flows**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Artificial neural networks, widely recognized for their role in machine learning, are also transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modeling with classical dynamical systems as well as enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Conceptual errors are error types that arise when reasoning about observations at many levels, from processing data and analyzing them statistically to conventional logic (and its fallacies) and interpretive practices (some shaped by heuristics and inherent cognitive biases). They include overgeneralizations, faulty assumptions, theory-laden judgment and confirmation bias, heuristic gaps, cognitive lapses, unaddressed alternatives, cryptic alternatives, and various forms of cultural bias—such as those based on religion, gender, race, class, or politics.</jats:p>

- **Simulating Atherosclerotic Plaque Growth in Coronary Arteries Using an AI-Driven ODE Model for Personalized Cholesterol-Driven Risk Dynamics**

  - 摘要：<title>Abstract</title>                 <p>This study introduces a simulation-based framework to model atherosclerotic plaque growth in coronary arteries, a critical factor in cardiovascular disease. The model uses a first-order ODE solved with MATLAB’s ode45 (a method for solving Equation ions) to show how plaque grows, which is affected by LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. For a fictitious group of 500 patients, a neural network uses characteristics such as age, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure to forecast individual ODE parameters. Simulations over 15 years produce personalized plaque trajectories, enabling risk stratification into low, medium, and high-risk groups. MATLAB-created visuals, like time-series graphs, cholesterol-plaque scatter plots, and 3D sensitivity surfaces, provide a clear understanding of how diseases progress and how different factors affect them. The model has been checked against known solutions, showing it is very accurate and highlighting how AI and math can work together in health informatics to improve personalized heart disease risk assessment and precision medicine.</p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The author focuses on neophrasemes with a sensory-taste component, functioning in humorous discourse in the digital age. The purpose of their study is to understand the neophraseologisation of super-word neologisms, which prove to be verbalisers of modern social attitudes and national stereotypes. The issue of their modelling is considered. It was revealed that the structural models (the main word from the thematic group “perfume productsˮ / “sweet drinkˮ / “culinary productˮ / “dairy productsˮ / “sensory sensationsˮ with a dependent noun) are traditional for the Russian language, but at the same time, each of the identified variants of the semantic content of the model is an example of a non-trivial combination of components (perfume with the smell of a computer, chewing gum with the taste of dog, cucumber compote, “Covid-19ˮ cheese, the sounds of a reserved seat carriage). The main cognitive procedures of neophraseologisation include slot replacement, frame structure expansion due to new knowledge, frame “shifts”. Particular attention is paid to linguocultural commentary and description of the intentions of jokes’ “anonymous authors” – participants in the process of creatively denouncing the world. Newly formed units testify to the linguocreative basis of neophraseologisation. The performed analysis of creative sensory-taste neophrases reveals the possibilities of pun in modern anecdotal discourse.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>In a 2008 essay ‘On Being Tolerated’, Leslie Green offers us a powerful and compelling strategy for soothing the sting of toleration: attempting to understand the meaning that the tolerated attach to their tolerated conduct. But understanding can only partially soothe the sting of toleration. Drawing on Gandhian thought and practice, this chapter suggests how we might round out the sharp edges of toleration even further, by extending and tweaking Green’s strategy. The chapter calls for a more holistic understanding of the tolerated that goes beyond understanding their tolerated conduct. The chapter expands on Green’s suggestion that toleration requires much more forbearance than is usually assumed, and calls for humility in dealing with the tolerated. Finally, to more fully soothe the sting of toleration, the chapter argues that we should advance from Green’s concern with fellowship to the ideal of fraternity.</jats:p>
