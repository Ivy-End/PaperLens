- **Robot Path Planning Based on the Tidal Optimization Algorithm: A New Swarm Intelligence Approach**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and intelligent robotics, enhancing a robot's ability to operate in complex, dynamic environments has become a key research focus. To address the core challenge within this domain—specifically, the limitations of traditional robot path planning methods such as slow convergence and the tendency to fall into local optima—this study proposes a novel Tidal Optimization Algorithm (TOA) inspired by the periodic and dynamic characteristics of ocean tides.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>The proposed TOA is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments. First, it is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms on the CEC 2017 benchmark suite, followed by applications to gridbased robot path planning tasks against four competitive algorithms. The results demonstrate that TOA achieves superior or highly competitive performance on most benchmark functions, confirming its strong global search capability. In path planning, TOA generates shorter and safer trajectories, outperforming all competitors.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>From the perspective of intelligent robotics, this research not only contributes a powerful optimization approach for path planning but also provides potential algorithmic insights for future applications in human–robot interaction, adaptive motion control, and Human Action Recognition–driven navigation systems.</jats:p>

- **Navigating the Meta-Epistemology of the Scientific Realism Debate: In Defense of Truth**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This article examines the meta-stance choice in the scientific realism debate. I propose that the epistemological aspect of this debate be reframed within an epistemological framework that views our cognitive activities as a trade-off between believing truths and minimizing errors. I identify two main alternatives to this meta-epistemological framework: firstly, the view that the realism debate involves a voluntary choice between incommensurable stances, such as an empirical and a metaphysical stance; secondly, the notion that stance selection is a result of negotiating between explanatory power and error avoidance. My proposal and the two alternatives have in common that they imply a form of epistemic voluntarism and explain the recurring stalemate in the debate. However, I argue that the presented proposal outclasses the competing perspectives due to its enhanced generality, impartiality, a more comprehensive explanation of the anti-realist sentiment, and its potential to mitigate the recurring stalemate.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>As tourism brings about economic benefits through spending, infrastructure development and investments, destination competitiveness has raised in the last decades interest in the scientific and academic literature. Then, researchers and policymakers are becoming more and more involved in finding the drivers of this phenomenon. However, the complexity and multidimensionality of destination competitiveness make its measurement a challenging task. One of the most powerful tools for measuring multidimensional phenomena is the composite index, and in this paper, a synthetic measure based on a non-compensatory approach for calculating destination attractiveness is proposed. This index, calculated for the Italian regions, is then compared with regional tourism performances, with the aim of assessing destination competitiveness. The results highlight the strength of this approach for the construction of a composite index, and show an original application on Italian regional data.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>This concluding chapter brings together where we are, where we have been, and where we need to go in order to begin addressing the learning gap defined by race and class. National test scores continue to slide postpandemic, but the problem of inequality has existed throughout history. An equitably funded, carefully monitored choice program that targets low-income, poorly performing students at chronically failing schools would be a step in the right direction. The gradualism of the Rehnquist court that nudged First Amendment jurisprudence to a more centrist position on the church-state divide was a positive move that allowed reformers to provide struggling students with access to better schools. More recent rulings by the Roberts court are lowering the wall of separation to levels that endanger the rights of vulnerable minorities. A new wave of choice legislation that makes choice less accessible to those who need it the most and proceeds with little or no accountability is both unsustainable and unjust.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Eco-labelling forest products through forest certification is a market-driven tool with a global influence. It is also met with challenges in acceptance and diffusion among stakeholders. Here the authors aim to provide a synthesis of forest certification impact and place this in the context of small private forest owners. The chapter starts with an introduction to the concept of forest certification and important governance and operations characteristics. Continued with a discussion about the impact of forest certification and how it can deliver environmental, social, and financial value. The case study focuses on the group of small private forest owners and their motivations to adopt forest certification. This is followed by a discussion about the logic behind forest certification for small private owners and what this could mean for the future of forest certification.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This chapter presents the country context for Sweden, focusing on three key areas: (a) First, the main inequalities in late working life, namely age, gender, income, education, region, sector, ethnicity/migration, care responsibilities and health. These sections are standardised across all the country chapters to allow for ease of comparison. (b) Second, the significant policy measures affecting inequalities in late working lives. This section has a particular emphasis on impact and focuses on employer-based age management policies, physical reforms, anti-age discrimination legislation, lifelong learning, flexible working, health protection and carer support. (c) Finally, the impact of the financial crisis on inequalities in late working life. This section looks at all the preceding information from this chapter in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and current world financial crisis. Focusing predominantly on older workers, this section looks at interim and longer-term policy changes and the implications for inequalities in extended working lives. The sections in this chapter are standardised with those for other country chapters to allow for easy cross-comparison.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>The chapter reviews several of Bell’s other major works, including several books and articles from major law reviews. The idea of racial surrogacy, which holds that disempowered people rely on others to advocate on their behalf and ultimately get disappointed grows out of the work of Ron Edmonds and Derrick Bell. This chapter takes deep dive into Bell’s work, Edmonds’ influence on him, and why it established him as the “Father of Critical Race Theory.” Bell’s foundational legal textbook on race introduces the work of Edmonds and Coons and the issues of school desegregation, fiscal equity, community control, and parental choice.</jats:p>
