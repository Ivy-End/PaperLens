  - 摘要：<jats:p>Ground-mounted photovoltaic systems – stepping stones for biodiversity in the agricultural landscape // The Institute for Biodiversity Information (IfBI) studied five open-space photovoltaic (PV) systems over a period of three years to assess their impact on local biodiversity. Recordings of bat calls using batcorders showed that photovoltaic systems are ideal hunting grounds. The high occurrence of insects and bats in PV systems suggests that, in addition to being obstacles, they also offer potential for species protection. It can be assumed that ground-mounted PV systems act as stepping stones in the agricultural landscape, as the species studied were found both in the systems and in the surrounding habitats.</jats:p>

- **Discourse, Materiality, and Agency within Everyday Social Interactions**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This Element investigates the interplay between language, discourse, and materiality by focusing on everyday social practices within corner shops and markets in Sydney, Australia. Drawing on linguistic ethnography and data from interactions involving objects, talk, and people, it explores how discourse and materiality are co-constituted. Employing theoretical perspectives from actor-network theory and the concept of mediational means/tools, the study reconceptualizes the role of non-human entities in meaning-making processes. It demonstrates that objects actively participate in shaping cultural practices and social dynamics, offering new insights that broaden applied linguistics' engagement with materiality. By treating objects as agents in discourse, this Element highlights the entanglement of language, agency, and the material world. It foregrounds the dynamic relationships between humans and non-humans in everyday communicative practices, bringing to the fore the significance of material conditions in the production of meaning and interaction.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Through a series of three dispatches, Menna Saber Abo Salem recounts her experiences as a university student navigating ongoing displacement. The series traces practices of resilience which have emerged for her in this ongoing crisis, through interwoven vignettes, poetry and photographs. The work meditates on the university as a dual form of shelter, as both physical sanctuary in crisis and symbolic locus of writerly production as resistance.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Landslides represent one of the most serious natural hazards in Italy, frequently resulting in fatalities and several damage to infrastructure. Recent advancements in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have enabled the development of monitoring systems that can monitor slope displacements continuously, accurately, and at relatively low cost. In this study, we present a monitoring network based on single-frequency GNSS sensors, integrated with rainfall data, applied to a large landslide affecting a village in the Carnic Alps (northern Italy). The objective is to showcase a practical example of continuous landslide monitoring using GNSS technology. By implementing a specific velocity threshold for GNSS measurements, we created an inventory of landslide reactivation events, which was then used to define rainfall thresholds based on data from two pluviometer stations. To enhance the interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used in the analysis, we adopted an innovative approach employing Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). This technique allowed for a straightforward assessment of the influence of cumulative rainfall across various time windows, facilitating the identification of the most critical accumulation periods.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The aim of this study is to analyze the development of regional infrastructure based on cluster policy, as well as to identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of this process. The article examines the main scientific approaches to cluster policy proposed by both foreign and domestic researchers. A critical analysis of modern publications devoted to the issues of regional infrastructure development through a lens of cluster policy was conducted. As a result of the study, the concept of “regional infrastructure development based on cluster policy” was formulated; its features and content were highlighted. The main directions, principles and problems related to the implementation of cluster policy in the regions of Russia are defined. Particular attention is paid to the impact of cluster policy on the socio-economic development of regions, as well as the management aspects of this process.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>With unprecedented popular support, Andrés Manuel López Obrador's rise to power as president of Mexico brought with it a vision of national transformation known as the "Fourth Transformation" (4T), which would renew the country by ending corruption and impunity, implementing financial austerity, abolishing neoliberalism, and prioritizing the poor. This research analyzes the influence of political discourse and outcomes on university students, offering a comprehensive view of the political phenomenon with an emphasis on its narrative, political strategies and links with media and society, leading to widespread citizen acceptance. Drawing on political science, communication, and populism, it provides an analysis of the transformation influenced by a polarizing leader who left indelible marks on Mexican history through communication strategies and public policies implemented in social programs to reach citizens. It uses a mixed methodology to recover personal and family perceptions of students from the Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo about the political phenomenon. It provides a context for the communication process and populism as a line of research, offering tools for understanding the link between political discourse, citizen perception, and the transformation experienced. The results obtained will be useful for future research, providing political scientists, communicators, political analysts, and public policymakers, as well as young higher education students, with information and methodologies to deepen their understanding of the work of government administration.</jats:p>
