  - 摘要：<jats:p>Neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, stroke, age-related macular degeneration, and central retinal artery occlusion, rob millions of their independence. Studying these diseases in human retinas has been hindered by the rapid loss of neuronal activity after death. While some CNS activity has been restored postmortem, synchronized neuronal transmission beyond 30 min has remained elusive. We overcome this barrier by reviving and sustaining light signal transmission in human retinas recovered up to 4 hours after death and stored for up to 48 hours. We also introduce infrared-based ex vivo imaging for precise sampling, a closed perfusion system for drug testing, and an ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion model in mouse and human retina. This platform enables testing of neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of drugs targeting oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity. Our advances question the irreversibility of ischemic injury, support preclinical studies in vision restoration, offer insights into treating CNS ischemia, and pave the way for human donor eye transplantation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Electrophysiological signals provide valuable insights into plant health, facilitating measures to enhance crop productivity. Despite advances in measurement methods, long-term (&gt;1 day) acquisition techniques remain limited, hindering continuous monitoring. Current long-term techniques rely on invasive electrodes, as noninvasive electrodes fall short in operational duration and conformability. Here, a capacitively coupled electrode with an adaptable coupling layer is developed for noninvasive, month-long electrophysiological monitoring on diverse plants. The adaptable coupling layer is formed by in situ sol-gel transition, followed by dehydration of thermoresponsive hydrogel on plants, achieving high conformability to complex surfaces and stable electrical coupling. For 1 month on trichome-covered plant surfaces, the electrode maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a gold-standard noninvasive electrode, which typically lasts a few hours. Long-term monitoring reveals drought-specific signal features that correlate with plant water status. Physiological investigations indicate an essential role of calcium and reactive oxygen species, highlighting the potential of our electrode in generating biological insights and inspiring plant sensing innovations.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early childhood education (ECE), highlighting its pedagogical potential, ethical challenges, and practical implications. Through a scoping review of recent scholarly literature and international reports, the paper outlines how AI technologies are increasingly shaping educational experiences for young learners. While AI presents promising avenues for enhanced assessment, inclusive learning, and reduced teacher workload, concerns regarding data privacy, reduced human interaction, and algorithmic bias remain significant. The paper emphasizes the importance of transparent, equitable, and developmentally appropriate implementation of AI in ECE. Recommendations include strengthening teacher training, designing locally relevant AI applications, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders. The study concludes that a balanced, critically reflective, and ethically grounded approach is essential to harness the full potential of AI in promoting meaningful, inclusive, and sustainable early learning environments.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Stablecoins are reshaping global finance, enabling low-cost payments, remittances, and inclusion, but also raising risks for sovereignty, consumer protection, and stability. This chapter examines regulatory challenges with a focus on Nigeria, drawing lessons from the EU's MiCA, the fragmented U.S. model, and Singapore's balanced approach. It pursues four aims: (i) review global and regional responses; (ii) position Nigeria as a test case for emerging economies; (iii) assess the Commonwealth Model Law as a harmonizable framework; and (iv) explore how regulation can mitigate risks while fostering inclusion. Using a qualitative, desk-based design combining doctrinal and comparative analysis, the study finds Nigeria's stance to be restrictive yet experimental: a banking ban excluded stablecoins, while the SEC and eNaira signaled cautious innovation. The Model Law's tiered, risk-based framework offers a path to balance sovereignty, stability, and innovation, making Nigeria a microcosm of Global South dilemmas.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Stablecoins have moved decisively into the centre of global digital finance, emerging as payment infrastructure, liquidity instruments, and potential public-purpose digital money. Evidence shows growing global convergence around proportionate, technology-neutral, and risk-based regulation, even as significant divergences persist in implementation, supervisory capacity, and treatment of novel models such as algorithmic stablecoins. Unique opportunities and vulnerabilities face emerging markets, where stablecoins can lower remittance costs and expand financial access while simultaneously raising concerns about dollarisation and monetary sovereignty. Ethical considerations, around surveillance, identity, humanitarian use, and private-sector dependency, remain central to responsible adoption. The Commonwealth Model Law on Stablecoins provides a forward-looking blueprint for harmonised, adaptive regulation. Its principles provide the foundation for safe, inclusive, and interoperable digital money systems capable of supporting the next generation of global finance.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<ns3:p>Although many processes shaping the Polish capital's suburbs have more universal or even global dimensions, the sources of some phenomena can undoubtedly be found in historical factors and planning omissions, as well as in legislation that has not kept pace with evolving needs. Warsaw's neighbouring commune, Wiazowna, was selected for analysis as it is an interesting example of an area where suburbanization processes are evident. However, it should be emphasized that they are still in the initial phase. The authors of this paper conducted research, including a trial implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based management procedure, which could be used in the future as part of the planning process. The assumption is to introduce scientific University expert knowledge into the city's urban management process. The outcomes can be utilized by existing participants in the urbanization process and effectively support the activities of local self-government. The second element, the effectiveness of which was tested, is the choice of the focus areas as the desirable nodes of further spatial development. The conducted research has shown that to rationalize the development of Wiazowna and protect its values, investment areas should be strengthened so that they achieve nucleus status, initiating further development.</ns3:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Once limited to crypto trading, stablecoins are now serving global roles in payments, settlements, and value storage, alongside tokenised deposits and CBDCs. As adoption grows, regulation must balance trust, stability, and innovation. This paper argues that special jurisdictions - such as city states and special economic zones - enable stablecoin innovation without risking macroeconomic stability. Through their adaptive regulation, pilot programmes, sandboxes, innovation ecosystems, and specialised dispute-resolution mechanisms, they create controlled environments where stablecoin models can be tested and scaled safely. Through case studies, including Hong Kong, Singapore, DIFC, among others, the paper makes a case that special jursidictions offer credible regulatory pathways to issuers, while acting as evidence-generating laboratories for regulators. Therefore, special jurisdictions are quietly shaping the future of money, where the regulator's role is evolving from merely being a rule-maker to being a co-innovator.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Background: While oral reading fluency (ORF) is linked to reading comprehension (RC) in African languages, the role of vocabulary remains underexplored. Objectives: This study investigated the relative contributions of ORF and vocabulary to RC in the first and second languages of three bilingual groups: Akan-English in Ghana, isiZulu-English in South Africa, and Shona-English in Zimbabwe and examined the ORF rate needed for 80% comprehension in each language. Method: A quantitative correlational design was used. Learners in Ghana (n = 158), South Africa (n =104), and Zimbabwe (n = 122) were assessed through convenience sampling. Constructs measured included: ORF, RC and receptive vocabulary tests. Results: Oral reading fluency was a strong predictor of RC in first and second languages. Learners needed to read between 89 and 109 words correct per minute (WCPM) in English to achieve 80% comprehension. For African languages ORF thresholds ranged from 47 WCPM (isiZulu) to 55 WCPM (Akan). Conclusion: Oral reading fluency emerged as a critical prerequisite for RC across bilingual populations. Without adequate ORF skills, vocabulary knowledge cannot support comprehension. Contribution: This study provides novel data on reading fluency and comprehension in under-researched African languages, particularly Akan and Shona. It proposes preliminary ORF benchmarks for Ghana and Zimbabwe and validates existing benchmarks for South Africa.</jats:p>

The top-down approach is for governing bodies to have independence, financial oversight, ensure transparency, have a preventative approach and provide incentives to clubs to perform well. The bottom-up approach is for owners to elicit custodianship of their club, ensure financial sustainability, be transparent and engage in meaningful communication with supporters.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Research limitations/implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This article advances the academic discussion of the field of football governance and accountability, specifically by applying downward accountability to fan-led governance and accountability in club football. A framework is also provided that can be used for future research to evaluate football governance and accountability.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Practical implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study provides a framework for professional football clubs and governing bodies to use in their approach to governance and accountability.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This is the first study to propose a framework of governance and accountability for professional football clubs and governing bodies.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

This paper aims to conceptualise employees’ perceived service robot support (PSRS) and to develop a validated scale to evaluate the impact of service robot adoption in the workplace.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>A five-stage study using a mixed-methods approach was conducted to generate and refine the scale with a series of validation analyses.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The eight-item PSRS scale includes three dimensions: affective support, instrumental support and responsive support. As a key job resource, affective support has been found could enhance employees’ work engagement and job satisfaction.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Practical implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The findings provide practical insights for hospitality managers. The PSRS framework helps employees and managers clearly understand the multifaceted support service robots can provide. Proactively facilitating effective interaction between employees and robots can improve operational efficiency and ultimately elevate service quality.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The development of the PSRS scale allows systematic measurement, providing a comprehensive understanding of how service robots support employees.
