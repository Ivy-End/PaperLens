  - 摘要：<jats:p>The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical research is transforming the landscape of biomedical innovation, influencing numerous phases of research, with critical ethical and legal implications. Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, commonly referred to as the AI Act and issued in 2024, introduced a new regulatory framework that classifies AI systems used in clinical settings as ‘high risk’, requiring increased scrutiny by ethics committees and national authorities. This review addresses ethical and regulatory challenges and discusses the application of the AI Act within real-world clinical research. We propose a three-phase lifecycle (training, real-world testing and post-marketing monitoring) to align regulatory burdens with AI maturity. Our recommendations include transparent protocol design with explicit data-use declarations, complementary application of the Medical Device Regulation and the AI Act, with particular attention to the early research phases. This approach provides practical indications for researchers and operational evaluation criteria for ethics committees to ensure patient safety while fostering trustworthy AI deployment in clinical trials.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The increasing demand for offset printing ink and the environmental impacts of petroleum-based materials have prompted a search for alternatives. This study aims to produce offset printing ink using used palm cooking oil as a substitute for petrochemical components. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of used cooking oil for ink production. The methodology involved collecting and puryfiying oil, converting it into Fatty Acid Metyl Ester (FAME), formulating varnish, and producting ink. The results showed that ink made from used cooking oil (FAME-J) differed in optical density and CIE Lab* values compared to conventional ink. Specifically, FAME-J exhibited a lower optical density than Ink FAME-S and Ink-K, suggesting a thinner ink layer. The CIE Lab* analysis showed that Ink FAME-J had a slightly darker color and a lower lightness (L*) value compared to Ink FAME-S, while Ink-K exhibited a higher yellow component. Overall, used cooking oil demonstrates it’s viability as an alternative for producing offset printing ink, offering a sustainable option to reduce environmental impacts and support waste management efforts.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium–ion batteries is a critical enabler for the safety, reliability, and energy efficiency of modern electric vehicles (EVs). However, the nonlinear, multi-scale, and condition-dependent nature of battery degradation presents formidable challenges for conventional prognostic models. This work proposes a high-performance hybrid prognostic architecture that synergistically integrates (i) multi-resolution feature extraction via the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), (ii) long-range temporal dependency modeling through an encoder–decoder Transformer network with multi-head self-attention, and (iii) nonlinear residual correction using XGBoost. To ensure globally optimal hyperparameter configuration and robust convergence, the full pipeline is optimized using the Chaotic Billiards Optimizer (CBO), complemented by local refinement with the Adam optimizer.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark battery aging datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and ensemble baselines, including recurrent neural networks, convolutionalrecurrent hybrids, transformer-based models, and gradient-boosted decision trees. The proposed approach achieves performance improvements exceeding 15% in both mean absolute error and root mean square error, with an average prediction accuracy characterized by a mean absolute error below 0.020, a root mean square error below 0.032, and a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.98. Ablation analyses further confirm the complementary contributions of multi-scale signal decomposition, attention-based temporal modeling, residual learning, and chaotic meta-heuristic optimization. Despite its hybrid structure, the framework remains computationally efficient, converging within a limited number of training epochs and enabling real-time inference (approximately 0.038 seconds per prediction window) with a lightweight model size of 2.14 million parameters, highlighting its suitability for embedded battery management systems.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Overall, the proposed framework establishes a robust and interpretable foundation for next-generation battery prognostics, enabling intelligent predictive maintenance, enhanced safety, and energy-aware management in electric mobility systems.</jats:p>

Existing works on human−robot interaction, however, have mostly focused on the impacts of anthropomorphism on consumer perception but attended much less to robotic zoomorphism (i.e. making robots animal-like). Drawing on literature on robotic morphology, stereotype content model and self-construal theory, this research aims to investigate the impacts of robotic zoomorphism on customer evaluations.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Four experimental studies (n = 1,221) were conducted among Chinese consumers to test a moderated serial mediation framework, which specifies the downstream effect of robotic zoomorphism on service satisfaction via warmth and eeriness, and the moderating role of chronic self-construal.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Study 1 reveals the role of warmth (vis-à-vis competence) in clustering human perception of generic animaloids. Studies 2A and 2B validate the serial mediation via enhanced warmth and reduced eeriness as the mechanism underlying the effect of robotic zoomorphism on hotel service satisfaction. Study 3 further demonstrates chronic self-construal as the individually varied condition that moderates the effect of robotic zoomorphism on warmth and on the mediation mechanism.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Practical implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The findings offer critical insights for mitigating the risks of adopting animaloids in the hospitality sector.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This research adds new knowledge to robotic hotel services by revealing the critical role of warmth in the differential judgment of animaloids, leading to important implications for the deployment of zoomorphic robots in hotels.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

Finally, static and dynamic measurement experiments on multicore cables were carried out using a cable eccentricity detection device.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The experimental results show that within the eccentricity range of 0–3.4 mm, the calculation error of eccentricity is within ±3% and the error of eccentric angle is within ±5%, which meets the accuracy requirements.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The designed array ECS can realize the measurement of cable eccentricity and offset angle, and has certain research significance.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Semantic memory retrieval is essential for language, thought, and adaptive behavior. Although both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the cerebellum have been implicated in this function, the role of the PFC remains poorly understood and the contribution of the cerebellum largely overlooked in current neurocognitive models. To address these gaps, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled experiment in which healthy adults received anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the left lateral PFC (n = 49), right posterior cerebellum (n = 50), or sham (n = 50). Participants completed a novel process-sensitive paradigm comprising lexical decision, free-associative (automatic) retrieval, dissociative (controlled) retrieval, and intrusion monitoring, while manipulating response predictability and rule switching. Cerebellar tDCS selectively impaired free-associative performance, particularly for cues evoking predictable responses, supporting its role in automatic access to overlearned associations. In contrast, prefrontal tDCS disrupted dissociative performance and increased associative intrusions, implicating the PFC in retrieval inhibition. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that the reduction in dissociative fluency was largely explained by higher probability of intrusions, indicating a perturbation of proactive inhibitory control that normally prevents irrelevant memory activations from entering working memory. Further exploratory analyses ruled out several alternative accounts of these stimulation effects, underscoring their process specificity. Together, these findings advance models of semantic cognition by demonstrating complementary contributions of the cerebellum to automatic retrieval and the PFC to inhibitory control over intrusions. More broadly, they highlight the translational potential of cerebellar- and prefrontal-focused interventions for individuals with language and executive deficits.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study investigates the rheological and optical properties of sustainable palm oil-based offset printing inks, comparing four formulations with varying pigment concentrations (Palm Ink-15, Palm Ink-16, Palm Ink-17, and Palm Ink-18) against a conventional ink sample. Through rheology testing, we analyzed viscosity, yield value, and shortness to understand ink flow characteristics. Optical density measurements and colorimetric assessments in CIE L*a*b* coordinates were conducted to evaluate ink performance across different film thicknesses. The results indicate that palm-based inks exhibit a superior balance between viscosity and yield value, allowing for effective ink transfer and enhanced color saturation. Palm Ink-17, in particular, demonstrated the most rapid color intensity buildup with increased thickness, making it optimal for applications requiring rich, saturated blue tones. These findings suggest that palm oil-based inks are not only environmentally friendly but also exhibit performance characteristics suitable for high-quality offset printing applications.</jats:p>

- **Outsourcing in the supply chain as a driver of vulnerability – The case of the Republic of Serbia**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Purpose: Outsourcing is a widely used supply strategy for activities in which firms lack sufficient or appropriate competencies. While it enhances efficiency, extensive outsourcing may reduce transparency and control, thereby limiting firms’ ability to detect disruptions and increasing supply chain vulnerability. This study examines to what extent outsourcing contributes to supply chain vulnerability in the context of the Republic of Serbia. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical survey was conducted among 52 large enterprises from various sectors in Serbia, all of which were listed among the most successful based on their net profit. Hypotheses were tested using statistical methods, specifically the χ2 test, cluster analysis, analysis of variance and linear regression in SPSS. Findings/results: The survey results indicate that the proportion of outsourced activities did not significantly affect supply chain vulnerability (p = 0.695 and p = 0.556), while greater dispersion of outsourced activities (p = 0.005 and p = 0.003) and higher supply chain complexity (p = 0.014 and p = 0.007) were statistically significant. These findings suggest that although the share of outsourced activities alone does not increase vulnerability, both dispersion and complexity significantly elevate it. Practical implications: These findings do not argue against outsourcing but emphasise the importance of enhanced risk management and contingency planning. Originality/value: This pilot study provides initial empirical evidence on the impact of specific outsourcing activities on supply chain vulnerability. It also lays the foundation for future research, potentially extending to broader studies across the Western Balkans, given the similar business context and interconnections among enterprises in the region.</jats:p>

Key success factors for leverage included long-term strategic vision, stakeholder involvement, using existing Olympic legacies and strong leadership commitment. Conversely, challenges that diminished leverage included limited resources, lack of intra-organizational support, inadequate planning and political changes.

We analyze this issue for the volatility processes of four digital currencies with high market capitalization using GARCH models.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Our cross-sectional findings suggest that after the transition to the PoS consensus protocol, cryptocurrency volatility becomes significantly less responsive to energy market shocks.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The findings of this study advocate for the migration from the energy-intensive PoW consensus protocol to the more environmentally sustainable PoS protocol. Moreover, this study advances the literature on green finance by documenting a strong case for cryptocurrency stakeholders to switch to the PoS protocol.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>
