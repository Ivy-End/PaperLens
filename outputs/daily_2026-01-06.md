Despite robots offering high repeatability, their single-shot accuracy diminishes under heavy loads, posing challenges in various applications. This paper introduces a 6-DoF sensor concept based on speckle shift measurements, which leverages the movement of speckle patterns generated by light scattering from an optically rough surface. By capturing speckle shifts at multiple image sensor positions, the sensor can distinguish between translations and rotations, enabling precise pose measurements. A precision below 2 μm for translations and 7 μrad for rotations, with trueness of 1.5 μm and 5.2 μrad, respectively, are experimentally shown for random 6-DoF movements. The speckle shift sensor is compared to established alternatives.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The multiband HSC-CLAUDS survey comprises several sky regions with varying observing conditions, only one of which, the COSMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF), offers extensive redshift coverage. We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i&lt;25 (złesssim 5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem that we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method was validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts were compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude were compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; and the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to OII emitters at z emission line galaxies. were compared to those of confirmed OII The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learned from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2, and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region  (∼ 4 million sources in total at i&lt;25) are made public.</jats:p>

While most investigations have focused on the sagittal plane, asymmetries may also arise in the frontal and transverse planes, with potential implications for both performance and health. The present study performed a three-dimensional analysis of joint moment asymmetries and examined the influence of pedalling power on their magnitude in ten amateur cyclists under three power conditions.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Methodology</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Asymmetries were quantified using a modified version of the Normalised Symmetry Index (NSI), the Cross-Correlation Coefficient (CCC), and the newly proposed metric Asymmetries During Cycle (ADC) index.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Results</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Results indicated that these indices must be applied jointly to identify whether asymmetries arise from magnitude differences, temporal pattern discrepancies, or both.

Based on the UTD 24 journals in the field of management studies, this article systematically collected over 50,000 top-tier papers from six sub-disciplines of management and identified research literature containing elements related to AI through natural language processing methods. Subsequently, two quantitative analyses were carried out. Firstly, the academic influence was quantified through citation analysis, which was a widely recognized approach for evaluating the impact of research works. Secondly, online attention was examined by leveraging the comprehensive altmetric attention score, a metric that captures the broader engagement and dissemination of academic papers across various online platforms.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study revealed contrasting associations of AI integration in management research. In terms of academic impact, AI-related papers in the management (general/strategy) and accounting sub-disciplines exhibited negative academic associations compared to non-AI counterparts. But this negative effect has been gradually weakening in recent years. Even the study found that after 2019, management (general/strategy) exhibited positive associations with the academic influence. While AI-related papers of the marketing sub-discipline outperformed non-AI papers in citation counts since 2013. Regarding online attention, the AI-related research in management (general/strategy) domain attained stronger online attention. Additionally, it was noteworthy that the female first authors might have achieved better academic or online engagement across some sub-disciplines.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Practical implications</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This research might prove to be an invaluable resource for researchers and journal editors in sub-fields. For researchers, this work would illuminate new pathways for exploring AI-related themes and methodologies within their specific domains. For journal editors, it could offer some inspiration for adjusting their research directions and review standards. For example, editors could encourage more submissions that bridge the gap between theory and practice in AI-related research, or that explore emerging AI applications in under-researched areas.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The proliferation of AI technologies has spurred increased scholarly attention across various domains of management research, prompting questions about its value-added contributions in social science. Firstly, this study pioneered the cross-disciplinary analysis of AI research in the management research domain, revealing divergent associations. Secondly, NLP-driven vocabulary detection was utilized, ensuring comprehensive topic recognition and optimizing the methodology for future interdisciplinary research assessments. Thirdly, female first authors were demonstrated to have superior academic and online visibility compared to their male counterparts across several management domains, which was somewhat different from the conclusions drawn by previous research.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

- **Desert lizards modulate nutritional responses to match seasonal biological needs**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Animals in extreme environments such as deserts experience severe seasonal fluctuations in abiotic conditions and resources. Under these conditions, they must obtain macronutrients in optimal amounts and ratios to meet their nutritional requirements, which themselves vary with seasonal changes in physiological and life-history processes. To understand whether nutritional intakes and retention align with key life-history events across seasons, we examined the nutritional ecology of the desert-dwelling lizard, Saara hardwickii. We first measured seasonal variation in the quantity and quality of plants available for these herbivorous lizards. By combining field observations of foraging behaviour with elemental analysis, we determined the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) levels in dietary intakes and faecal matter across seasons. Intake C : N was lowest and faecal C : N was highest in June, reflecting greater proportional consumption and retention of N, likely meeting increased protein demands during breeding. Conversely, dietary C : N and faecal %N were highest in October, indicating greater consumption and retention of C prior to hibernation. Surprisingly, these putative herbivores consumed insects only around the breeding season, despite their year-round availability. Overall, we show that S. hardwickii use both behavioural diet choice and post-ingestive physiology to match seasonal nutritional needs by differentially consuming and retaining nutrients in an extreme environment.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Abstract Enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation (EICP) has emerged as a versatile approach for soil improvement and contaminant immobilisation, yet performance is commonly evaluated from bulk metal removal efficiency while the mineralogical fate of retained metals remains poorly understood. Here, Pb, Co and Cr are compared under identical urease-driven EICP conditions using a crude soybean-derived urease extract, with metal retention pathways resolved through SEM–EDS, powder X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement, FTIR spectroscopy and chemical-field imaging/μXRF mapping. Across all treatments (2–20 mM), Pb and Co amended systems maintained high alkalinity (final pH ≈ 8.1–8.2) and high removal efficiencies (&amp;gt;99% for Pb; 97–99% for Co) but exhibited contrasting mineralogical outcomes. Pb showed a concentration-dependent transition from calcite-dominated assemblages to progressive stabilisation of a discrete Pb-carbonate population: cerussite was absent at low Pb, emerged at intermediate loading (~3 wt%) and increased at high loading (~6 wt%), coexisting with CaCO₃ domains bearing low Pb association and intra-particle chemical zoning. In contrast, Co remained associated with calcite-dominated products across all concentrations, with no evidence for a discrete cobalt carbonate phase; Co occurs at low wt% levels distributed diffusely within CaCO₃-rich domains. Chromium displayed the strongest divergence from carbonate-dominated behaviour. Increasing Cr loading reduced ureolysis, precipitate mass (to ~0.5 g at 20 mM) and removal efficiency (to ~87%), and was accompanied by an abrupt transition to abundant elongated prismatic morphologies. SEM–EDS identifies chemically discrete Cr-rich, Ca-poor domains together with Ca–S-rich precipitates exhibiting gypsum-like habits, indicating a shift from carbonate-controlled mineralisation towards sulphate-associated retention pathways at high loading. Together, these results demonstrate that under otherwise identical crude-enzyme EICP conditions, metal identity redirects carbonate biomineralization into distinct crystallogenetic pathways, with direct implications for predicting immobilisation mechanisms and remediation design.</jats:p>

Communication managers see opportunities in informal communication, such as fostering a positive organizational culture, promoting integration, building social relationships and enabling knowledge sharing. It is also valued for facilitating feedback, gauging employee sentiment and providing space for employees to share opinions and experiences. However, respondents identified risks such as misinformation, gossip, and the uncontrolled dissemination of sensitive information. These risks present challenges for communication managers, who must mitigate them while leveraging the benefits of informal communication. In addition, the study shows that managers perceive remote and hybrid work environments as significant challenges to informal communication.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study is one of the first to examine informal communication from the perspective of communication managers, considering the specific challenges of remote work contexts.

The most recent taxonomic work on Indian Diplura, dating to 1977, is a description of Lepidocampa juradii bengalensis Rani &amp; Mitra, 1977. The current study also rediscovered this subspecies after decades from two different geographic locations in West Bengal, India. GenBank contains only Lepidocampa weberi Oudemans, 1890 COI sequences; however, sequences of other group members are necessary for drawing the phylogenetic relationships of this crucial evolutionary group. This study provided DNA barcodes for L. juradii bengalensis for the first time from around the globe. As the scattered nature of information and the unavailability of old bibliographic references complicate the study of Indian Diplura, we provide an updated checklist of Indian Diplura, along with references.  </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Decision curve analysis (DCA) bridges the gap between statistical accuracy and clinical usefulness – a distinction frequently overlooked in diagnostic research. Using a simulated cohort representing a real-world diagnostic scenario, this tutorial demonstrates how predictors with similar ROC-based performance can yield markedly different net benefit profiles when evaluated through DCA. Three tools were compared: a strong predictor (composite clinical score), a moderate biomarker (leukocytes), and a weak marker with modest AUC but limited practical value (serum sodium). Whereas ROC curves portray discrimination alone, decision curves situate performance within real clinical trade-offs, making explicit when a model adds value beyond default strategies such as treating all or none. The tutorial provides a step-by-step framework for interpretation, clarifies frequent misconceptions (thresholds, prevalence effects, calibration), and illustrates how DCA incorporates the consequences of decisions rather than just their statistical accuracy. Rather than adding ‘just another metric’, DCA reframes evaluation around a practical question: does using this model improve decisions across clinically reasonable thresholds?</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>يشهد النظام الدولي لحظة تحوّل نوعي مع تعاظم القوة الصينية، إذ انتقلت الصين من خطاب النهضة السلمية إلى إعادة تعريف ذاتها كفاعل مركزي يمتلك إرادة التأثير في اتجاهات العالم. لقد انعكس هذا التحوّل بوضوح على السياسة الخارجية الصينية التي تبنّت إطاراً مفاهيمياً جديداً هو الحماية النشطة؛ وهو تصور يستند إلى توظيف القوة الاقتصادية والعسكرية معاً لحماية المصالح الوطنية خارج الحدود وضمان أمن المبادرات الاستراتيجية، وفي مقدمتها "الحزام والطريق".وتعبّر هذه المقاربة عن رؤية صينية لإعادة تشكيل قواعد التفاعل الدولي، عبر توسيع النفوذ البحري، وتعزيز القدرات العسكرية، والانخراط المتنامي في مؤسسات الحوكمة العالمية. وقد أثار هذا الصعود استجابات دولية متباينة، تجلت في سياسات احتواء وتحالفات أمنية مضادة، ما يعكس دخول النظام الدولي طوراً جديداً من التعددية القطبية. وتخلص الدراسة إلى أن تحوّل القوة الصينية لم يعد مجرد تطور داخلي، بل أصبح عنصراً بنيوياً يعيد صياغة موقع الصين ودورها في النظام الدولي المعاصر.</jats:p>
