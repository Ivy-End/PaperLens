  - 摘要：<jats:p>There is a need for new strategies to cope with the growing intricacy of air traffic control (ATC) systems so that the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the ATC are guaranteed. Machine learning (ML) has become a disruptive technology that introduces innovative methods of managing and processing enormous amounts of data generated in the ATC context. This chapter looks into how ML developments contribute to the responsiveness and progress of current ATC systems, especially where image processing and intelligent algorithms are concerned. ML application in anomaly detection, object recognition, trajectory prediction, and system optimization is analyzed. Essentially, it employs advanced methods built on various models, for instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and unsupervised learning methods to describe how ML improves aircraft detection and tracking, decision-making, and risk minimization. Important case studies and ML applications that have been developed and implemented in the ATC industry are presented. Other issues like data diversity, requirements for real-time processing, and regulatory issues are addressed. Besides, the chapter discusses future possibilities, such as how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), reinforcement learning (RL), and hybrid models will be incorporated into next-gen surveillance systems. The goal of this chapter is to motivate researchers and practitioners in air traffic surveillance to take advantage of ML by providing a vision of the current state of the art and future possibilities.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Air traffic management (ATM) is a complex and dynamic system that evaluates performance and improving operations presents significant challenges. The integration of machine learning (ML) and image processing has emerged as a transformative approach to enhancing ATM systems. With air traffic volumes continually increasing, the demand for efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions to ensure safety and operational excellence has become more critical than ever. The constructive interaction of ML and image processing techniques addresses the multifaceted challenges of ATM, including flight delay prediction, runway monitoring, aircraft recognition, and anomaly detection. A structured framework for data-driven analysis and optimization in ATM utilizes time series analysis, ML, and metaheuristic techniques. Techniques like object detection, edge detection, and segmentation are employed to identify critical visual patterns, such as aircraft positions, weather disturbances, and ground operations. ML models are then utilized to analyze these patterns, enabling predictive insights and real- time decision- making. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to classify aircraft types and detect anomalies, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers are leveraged for time-series analysis, such as predicting flight delays based on historical and real-time data. One of the primary contributions of this work is the application of ML and image processing in real-time air traffic monitoring and control. By integrating visual data from air traffic control (ATC) systems and other sensors, the framework enables continuous evaluation of runway occupancy, weather conditions, and aircraft movements. This approach serves as a practical ML guide for optimizing continuous aviation systems.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Corpus-assisted ecolinguistics is an emerging area of linguistic enquiry that integrates the methodological repertoire of corpus-assisted discourse studies with the theoretical framework of ecolinguistics to study language and its impacts on the life-sustaining relationships among humans, other species, and the natural environment. It enables researchers to identify linguistic features and patterns that perpetuate particular forms of discourse and to uncover the underlying ecological worldviews, perceptions, and beliefs embedded within them through the systematic examination of large computerized textual datasets. Drawing on an in-depth interview with Robert Poole, this article aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to corpus-assisted ecolinguistics. It begins with a brief overview of recent developments in ecolinguistics and then examines the historical, theoretical, and methodological aspects of corpus-assisted ecolinguistics. The article concludes by discussing future directions for corpus-assisted ecolinguistics and recommending relevant resources for further research and practice.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This research essay investigates the intersections of policy and public interest technology within the context of the Public Interest Technology University Network and presents the findings from interviews conducted with U.S. based faculty and staff who are members of PIT-UN, as well as affiliated funders and other personnel, in combination with desk research. Policy, defined as “a complex assemblage of issues, processes, procedures, and restraints,” recognizes that policy goes beyond regulatory documents, and sets the atmosphere for the success of PIT programs on campuses. In investigating policy and PIT-UN, this research examines the key areas including the role of university policy, administrators, and funders in setting and enforcing policy and how these might change to ensure the success of PIT programs in the future. It concludes by offering recommendations for administrators, funders, and those working in PIT at higher education institutions.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The shortage of professional caregivers and an aging population in Western countries contribute to high workloads in hospitals, which can negatively affect patient care and increase nurse turnover. Robotic assistance has the potential to alleviate these workloads. We conducted a design case study to identify application scenarios to reduce nurses’ administrative challenges. We found that tasks such as patient admissions and escorting patients to in-house medical appointments often constitute invisible work, which can be supported by a robot. Observations and follow-up semi-structured interviews with nursing staff highlight the potential of robots to reduce workload. At the same time, successful implementation requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including nursing staff, patients, and bystanders. Moreover, our findings show that invisible human work by nurses was often needed to maintain the robot’s functionality.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study presents integrated methodology for using RTK and non-RTK UAV systems in open-pit mining surveying. Three experiments were performed using DJI Mavic 3E RTK and DJI Mini 3 Pro drones at an altitude of 61.5 m with an overlap of 80%×75% over identical sites. A network of 12 precisely located control points allowed for a comparative assessment of the accuracy between RTK+GCP, non-RTK+GCP, and RTK-only configurations. Statistical analysis using multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significance of the positioning technology for survey accuracy. The RTK system achieved RMS errors of 2.88-5.23 cm versus 17.27-22.94 cm for non-RTK systems, representing a 5-6-fold increase in accuracy. This comparison demonstrates that RTK without ground control points maintains comparable accuracy (5.23 cm) to RTK with control points (4.45 cm), while reducing operating costs by 84%. Analysis of camera position accuracy showed an accuracy of 2.04-2.06 cm RMS regardless of the use of control points. These results confirm that RTK methodology is cost-effective for standard surveying, achieving geodetic-grade accuracy without traditional field support infrastructure. The methodology allows for continuous monitoring of mining operations while reducing costs and increasing accuracy.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>In the context of varying ore quality indicators at mining open-pit mines, ongoing grade control is very important and affects the economic performance of the mining enterprise. The article analyses modern methods and ways of current grade control. A method for qualitative indicators assessment in an open pit mine and data processing using modern software is presented. An algorithm for grade control in the process of drilling and mining is analysed and presented. The main data is the geological database, which is updated during operational exploration and planning. Updates are carried out during the blast hole sampling and preparation of the massif for blasting. The dense network of blast holes allows to clarify the contours of high-grade and low-grade ores, which allows to control the order of ore material mining and form cargo flows in the open pit. As shown by the comparison of the parameters of waste rock, high-grade and low-grade ores in the mining block using the resource and operating models, the tonnage and quality of materials can be increased or decreased due to clarification. The article presents the grade control workflow in open pit mining as a generalised algorithm using advanced Micromine software.</jats:p>

- **Beyond Polishing: The Compounding Dynamic of GenAI in Academic Writing**

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Generative AI can reshape stance and voice in multilingual student writing, with effects that appear to be shifting over time. Using a random sample of English L2 master’s-level assignments at a UK university from two cohorts (2019 and 2025, N = 25 each), I first compared submitted drafts, then subjected parallel excerpts to GenAI “polishing” prompts. Across both cohorts, the technology consistently reduced hedging, suppressed self-mention, and reframed authorial stance into more categorical and impersonal forms. While these outcomes confirm existing critiques of homogenisation, the more revealing finding is a compounding dynamic. I use this term within an ecological view of writing and technological mediation to describe how AI-mediated drafting and AI-based polishing interact in the same writing environment. The 2025 students’ original texts, acknowledged by most to have been written with GenAI support, already resembled AI outputs, and polishing then reinforced the drift. Compared to the 2019 cohort, their drafts contained fewer hedges, greater lexical diversity, and syntactically simpler sentences. This longitudinal perspective shows how the stylistic fingerprints of GenAI are being internalised within writing practices, narrowing rhetorical space even before the tool is explicitly applied. I highlight the pedagogical imperative of critical AI literacy: that writers must be trained to use generative AI effectively by interrogating its outputs, resisting its homogenising pull, and preserving their intended stance.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The Atrato River judgement is one of the groundbreaking decisions in rights of nature. A model for further legislation and case-law, the ruling advanced environmental guardianship, and envisaged democratic, pluralistic environmental management and restoration plans for degraded waterways. However, when taking stock of its scope for substantive action, most of the ruling provisions would amount for environmental ‘law-for-show’. Lack of funding provisions, complex institutional cooperation arrangements, excessive reliance on under-resourced governments, and exacerbated reporting are signs of gestural compliance of the judgement. Despite its implementation challenges, the judgement has excelled in law’s communicational function of bringing forward river degradation in an illegal mining context to frame community guardian action. Its real success, therefore, is rather to be measured on the achievements of the riverine communities’ political struggle as guardians, than on the limited substantive action within the Colombian Constitutional Court’s orders.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>                     The evolution of negation is typically characterized as a cyclical process, whereby new constructions emerge to encode existing functions. The current corpus-based study undertakes an investigation into the evolution of the negative existential negator                     <jats:sc>yok</jats:sc>                     ‘non.exist’ in Turkish Sign Language (TİD). It seeks to investigate the applicability of the negative existential cycle as proposed by Croft (1991) and examines its potential as an explanatory framework in understanding the sources and pathways of standard negation. Here it is evidenced that this cycle occurs within a specific language and TİD presents aspects of stage B ∼ C: the existential negator                     <jats:sc>yok</jats:sc>                     gradually substitutes for the verbal negator                     <jats:sc>deĞİl</jats:sc>                     in specific contexts of the grammatical system. The present analysis offers a novel perspective on the comprehensive structure of the TİD negation system. This perspective posits that the existential negator                     <jats:sc>yok</jats:sc>                     does not merely signify the negation of existence; rather, it also functions as a standard negator. The determination is substantiated by the negative existential cycle, establishes a framework for understanding the relationship between existential negation and standard negation.                   </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>From classical times until today, cities have been conceived in the western imagination as ideally confined to the fixities of the land, a space defined in opposition to the fluxes of the sea. Whereas solid land afforded a durable platform for the establishment of property and citizenship, the fluid sea allowed markets---isolated within the secure boundaries of cities---to be connected across the globe though navigation.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Urban Liquefaction: Rethinking the Relationship between Land and Sea attends to the concurrent tensions between solidity and fluidity, permanence and impermanence, and substance and change that remain at the core of the western intellectual tradition, often dividing what is perceived as social from what is perceived as natural in life. Sea level rise poses unprecedented threats to this oppositional relationship, forcing us to reconsider the tension between solidity and fluidity in the design of the built environment. Nearly ten percent of all major cities are likely to be impacted by sea level rise in the coming decades, compromising the necessary infrastructure on which urban life depends. In reality, urban landscapes have been continually in flux, which becomes dramatically visible to urban dwellers mostly in catastrophic events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, alluvions, sinkholes and, above all, soil liquefaction.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Urban Liquefaction gathers contributions from scholars and practitioners working across continents and fields interested in urban life in (and after) the Anthropocene, including anthropology, archaeology, art, architecture, design, human geography, and science studies, to open up an inquiry into these categorical tensions and to speculate on alternative futures for the built environment.</jats:p>
