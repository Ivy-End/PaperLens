  - 摘要：<jats:p>Musculoskeletal injuries are among the most common causes of disability worldwide, with early detection and appropriate intervention critical to minimizing long-term complications. Infrared thermography (IRT) has emerged as a non-invasive, real-time imaging modality that captures superficial temperature changes reflecting underlying physiological processes such as inflammation and vascular alterations. This review explores the fundamental principles of medical thermography, differentiates between passive and active approaches, and outlines key technological advancements including artificial intelligence integration. The clinical utility of IRT is discussed in various contexts – ranging from acute soft tissue injuries and overuse syndromes to chronic pain and rehabilitation monitoring. Comparative insights with conventional imaging techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are also presented. While IRT offers functional imaging capabilities with advantages in portability, safety, and speed, its limitations – such as lack of deep-tissue penetration and protocol standardization – remain significant barriers to broader adoption. Future directions include the integration of IRT with other imaging modalities and digital health platforms to enhance musculoskeletal assessment and injury prevention strategies.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Speech development requires precise timing and sensorimotor integration, supported by neural oscillations that synchronize activity across auditory, motor, and cognitive circuits. Among speech-relevant frequency bands, beta oscillations (13–30 Hz) are critical for timing and coordination, supporting sensorimotor processing and speech preparation. Beta desynchronization (power decreases) is typically observed prior to movement, reflecting motor planning, and beta activity also supports cognitive functions such as attention and anticipation. Although age-related changes in beta power have been documented, its developmental trajectory during speech processing remains underexplored. Here, we compared beta power dynamics in 28 adults (mean age = 27.8 yr) and 50 children (mean age = 10.3 yr) during speech perception and production tasks using EEG. On each trial, participants received a visual cue indicating the condition (“Say,” “Hear,” or “See”), followed by rhythmic tones and a warning cue presented as a picture with its name (e.g., cat) in Say and Hear, but only as a picture in See. A Go cue then prompted participants to speak, listen, or maintain fixation. Beta power was analyzed in three time windows: postwarning cue (P1), pre-Go cue (P2), and post-Go cue (P3). Adults exhibited significant beta power decreases across all time windows, particularly in Say, indicating mature sensorimotor and cognitive integration. In contrast, children showed no significant condition effects and minimal beta reduction in P3. Beta modulation was negatively correlated with age in children, suggesting ongoing maturation of beta oscillations. These findings highlight key developmental differences in beta oscillations relevant to speech processing.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To describe the technique and the outcomes of manual Bowman layer and stroma transplant-onlay (BLST-o) for 2 cases of radial keratotomy (RK). METHODS: Two patients with visual fluctuations and corneal irregularity due to RK were offered manual BLST-o as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Visual acuity, refraction, corneal topography, corneal aberrometry, and corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) pre- and postoperative were analyzed. Histology was obtained for 1 case. RESULTS: Both patients had corneal anatomical and morphological improvement, with elimination of the visual fluctuations. In one case, a subsequent excimer laser treatment improved corneal shape further, thus improving vision. The other case, whereas initially improved, developed epithelial ingrowth following suture removal. The latter was explanted and had a xenogeneic implant. The explanted sample was sent for histology, showing a viable graft of Bowman layer and anterior stroma. CONCLUSION: Manual BLST-o is a potential option for the management of symptoms post RK. These grafts may facilitate subsequent treatments such as laser corrections, and may not preclude from other interventions after explantation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To summarize publication trends in the field of strabismus over the past 30y and predict future research hotspots. METHODS: A total of 2915 English-language articles and reviews on strabismus, published between 1993 and 2022, were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software to explore publication trends, as well as the contributions and collaborative networks of countries/regions, authors, institutions, and journals. RESULTS: The annual number of publications on strabismus showed a consistent upward trend. The United States (USA) maintained a leading position in this research field while Republic of Korea and China emerged as rapidly advancing contributors over the last decade. The University of California, Los Angeles ranked as the most productive institution, and Jonathan M. Holmes from USA was the most productive author. Journal of AAPOS was the leading journal with the most strabismus publications, whereas the two most highly cited articles were both published in Ophthalmology. Co-occurrence analysis identified pivotal keywords and burst terms, including intermittent exotropia (IXT), acute acquired comitant esotropia (AACE), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and surgical treatment, which were confirmed as predominant and frontier topics. CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of strabismus research, revealing the evolution of research hotspots over the past 30y and outlining several cutting-edge directions for future investigation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the total computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) score as a predictive tool for identifying individuals with symptomatic binocular vision anomalies and refractive errors. METHODS: A total of 141 healthy computer users underwent comprehensive clinical visual function assessments, including evaluations of refractive errors, accommodation (amplitude of accommodation, positive relative accommodation, negative relative accommodation, accommodative accuracy, and accommodative facility), and vergence (phoria, positive and negative fusional vergence, near point of convergence, and vergence facility). Total CVS-Q scores were recorded to explore potential associations between symptom scores and the aforementioned clinical visual function parameters. RESULTS: The cohort included 54 males (38.3%) with a mean age of 23.9±0.58y and 87 age-matched females (61.7%) with a mean age of 23.9±0.53y. The multiple regression model was statistically significant [R²=0.60, F=13.28, degrees of freedom (DF=17 122, P&lt;0.001]. This indicates that 60% of the variance in total CVS-Q scores (reflecting reported symptoms) could be explained by four clinical measurements: amplitude of accommodation, positive relative accommodation, exophoria at distance and near, and positive fusional vergence at near. CONCLUSION: The total CVS-Q score is a valid and reliable tool for predicting the presence of various non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies and refractive errors in symptomatic computer users.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p xml:lang="tr">Optimization of power generation scheduling is critical for generating companies (GENCOs) operating in deregulated electricity markets, where maximizing profit under operational constraints is challenging. Traditional metaheuristic algorithms often suffer from premature convergence and poor exploration-exploitation balance. Here we propose an improved Whale Optimization Algorithm incorporating chaotic mapping and inertia weight (CWOA-IW) to enhance population diversity and convergence behaviour. The algorithm is applied to the profit maximization problem of GENCOs, considering market prices and system constraints. Validation on 23 benchmark functions and three power system test cases (3-unit 10-bus, IEEE 39-bus, IEEE 118-bus) demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and faster convergence compared to standard WOA, Grey Wolf Optimizer, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The results indicate that CWOA-IW provides a robust and scalable optimization framework, offering practical benefits for GENCOs in competitive electricity markets.</jats:p>

- **Functional assessment of disability based on ICF and its impact on shaping the support benefit system for people with disabilities**

  - 摘要：<ns3:p>Background: The Support Benefit System in Poland, introduced in 2023, provides financial assistance to people with disabilities to support their daily living needs. This system allows individuals to independently manage the allocated resources based on their level of disability, assessed through a standardized questionnaire. The system includes various types of disabilities, and physiotherapists now play a key role in the assessment process. This initiative aims to empower people with disabilities to make decisions about their care.Aim of the study: This study aims to analyze applications and decisions related to the support benefit, taking demographic data into account, and to examine how the type and severity of disability affect the assigned scores.Material and methods: The data for this analysis were sourced from reports by the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy and the Provincial Disability Assessment Teams. As applications are still being submitted and assessed, the number of applications and decisions may change.Results: In the first year, 208.1 thousand decisions were issued out of 349.9 thousand applications. The 71–80 age group submitted the largest number of applications (23.64%). A significant correlation was found between age and support points—older individuals received higher scores. No major gender-based differences were observed, although women appeared more frequently in higher score brackets. Greater disability severity was clearly associated with a higher number of points. The most common types of disability were musculoskeletal and neurological disorders.Conclusions: The analysis indicates that older individuals, especially those over 80 years of age, tend to receive higher scores. Although greater disability severity correlates with a higher number of points, some individuals with milder conditions also achieve high scores, underscoring the importance of functional assessment. Women more often fall into higher score ranges, possibly due to greater longevity. Musculoskeletal and neurological disorders predominate among older adults, highlighting ongoing demographic shifts.</ns3:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To ascertain the pattern of ocular morbidity in a population of primary school children in rural Kenya as it is a prerequisite for planning effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of ocular symptoms and clinical eye examinations were performed in a sample of 35 rural primary schools in the semi-arid region of Kajiado West sub-county in S.W. Kenya, amongst a semi-nomadic tribe (Maasai). Students in Grades 1-8 were included. Visual acuity was measured using the Snellen “tumbling E” chart at 6 m. Children with symptoms of refractive error underwent non-cycloplegic refraction. RESULTS: A total of 2036 children (1084 males) between the ages of 4-20y were examined. Conjunctival actinic changes were present in 22% (442/2036). Nine cases were seen with a potential squamous carcinoma. No overt classical ocular signs of vitamin A deficiency were noted, although 181 (8.9%) children complained of nyctalopia. Three hundred thirty-six (16.5%) children had a visual acuity worse than 6/12 in either eye, were unable to read N10 near text at 40 cm or had symptoms suggestive of refractive error. Refractive data led to an estimate of hyperopia of +1.00 D or more in 3.9% and of myopia of -0.50 D or more in either eye in 3.0% of the study population. CONCLUSION: Solar exposure- and dust-related conjunctival pathology is common. As this may develop into potentially sight- or even life-threatening conditions, it warrants further study, and preventive strategies may be needed. Complaints of nyctalopia were common and could suggest vitamin A deficiency. The prevalence of refractive errors is low in this rural African population.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a serious ocular condition marked by the separation of the neuroretina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The pathogenesis of RRD involves intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms, including inflammation, cell migration, and the activation of proliferative signaling pathways. One of the most challenging complications of RRD is proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), which refers to the proliferation and contraction of fibrocellular membranes on the retinal surface and in the vitreous cavity. PVR is a major cause of surgical failure in RRD, as it can lead to recurrent retinal detachment and severe vision loss. However, the pathogenesis of PVR is not yet fully understood, and the treatment options are quite limited. Recent advances in analytical techniques have offered valuable insights into the molecular alterations present in the subretinal fluid (SRF) of patients with RRD. This review seeks to consolidate the current knowledge regarding the SRF profile in RRD and PVR, emphasizing potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Overt and harmful diabetes mellitus (DM) has detrimental effects on individuals and, by extension, the community. Among the microvascular DM complications is diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR may cause irreversible vision deterioration in cases of poor blood glucose regulation. Changes in vascular permeability are key trigger points for diabetic macular edema (DME), a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the macula. The development of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors has provided a pathogenesis-based treatment approach for DME. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution imaging of the anatomy, including the aging of DME and its structural damage, in distinct morphologic subtypes of macular edema, thereby supporting the assessment of macular edema treatment. The availability of repeated OCT monitoring provides clinical reassurance through the treatment. OCT angiography (OCTA) provides retinal blood flow maps with high spatial resolution. The ability promotes an understanding of disease pathogenesis and facilitates the implementation of new therapeutic methods. This review compares the potential of OCT and OCTA in the diagnosis and treatment of DME, as well as their respective therapeutic applications.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To evaluate long-term visual field (VF) prediction using K-means clustering in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: Patients who underwent 24-2 VF tests ≥10 were included in this study. Using 52 total deviation values (TDVs) from the first 10 VF tests of the training dataset, VF points were clustered into several regions using the hierarchical ordered partitioning and collapsing hybrid (HOPACH) and K-means clustering. Based on the clustering results, a linear regression analysis was applied to each clustered region of the testing dataset to predict the TDVs of the 10th VF test. Three to nine VF tests were used to predict the 10th VF test, and the prediction errors (root mean square error, RMSE) of each clustering method and pointwise linear regression (PLR) were compared. RESULTS: The training group consisted of 228 patients (mean age, 54.20±14.38y; 123 males and 105 females), and the testing group included 81 patients (mean age, 54.88±15.22y; 43 males and 38 females). All subjects were diagnosed with POAG. Fifty-two VF points were clustered into 11 and nine regions using HOPACH and K-means clustering, respectively. K-means clustering had a lower prediction error than PLR when n=1:3 and 1:4 (both P≤0.003). The prediction errors of K-means clustering were lower than those of HOPACH in all sections (n=1:4 to 1:9; all P≤0.011), except for n=1:3 (P=0.680). PLR outperformed K-means clustering only when n=1:8 and 1:9 (both P≤0.020). CONCLUSION: K-means clustering can predict long-term VF test results more accurately in patients with POAG with limited VF data.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To identify early biomarkers associated with glaucomatous visual field (VF) progression in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). METHODS: This study included patients were divided into two groups based on disease progression status. Tear samples were collected for proteomic analysis. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry combined with bioinformatic analyses was performed to identify and validate potential protein biomarkers for NTG progression. Additionally, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were evaluated using mediating effect models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (20 eyes) with NTG participated in this study, including 10 patients (4 males and 6 females; 10 eyes) in the progression group with mean age of 67.70±9.03y and 10 patients (4 males and 6 females; 10 eyes) in the non-progression group with mean age of 68.60±7.58y. A total of 158 significantly differentially expressed proteins were detected. UniProt database annotation identified 3 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these DEPs were mainly enriched in pathways such as oocyte meiosis. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed functional clusters related to cellular processes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that the core proteins were primarily involved in the neurodegeneration-multiple diseases pathway and cellular processes. Mediating effect analysis identified PRDX4 (L) as a potential protein biomarker. ROC curve analysis showed that GNAI1 had the largest area under the curve (AUC=0.889). CONCLUSION: This study identifies 15 differentially expressed proteins in the tear fluid of NTG patients, including PRDX4 (L). PRDX4 (L) plays a key role in oxidative stress.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To investigate the effects of shortening the duration of silicone oil tamponade on retinal structure and function in patients undergoing silicone oil removal (SOR) after surgery for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). METHODS: A total of 58 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups based on tamponade duration: the short-term group (30-45d) and the conventional group (≥90d). Comprehensive evaluations were performed before and after SOR, including slit-lamp examination, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement, intraocular pressure (IOP) testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), microperimetry, electroretinography (ERG), and visual evoked potential (VEP) assessment. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (23 males and 10 females; 33 eyes) were enrolled in the short-term SO tamponade group with mean age of 52.45±9.35y, and 25 patients (15 males and 10 females; 25 eyes) were enrolled in the conventional SO tamponade group with mean age of 50.80±12.06y. Compared with the conventional group, the short-term silicone oil tamponade group had a significantly lower incidence of silicone oil emulsification and cataract progression, with no significant difference in retinal reattachment success rate. Structurally, short-term tamponade was associated with increased thickness of the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) in the nasal and superior macular regions and improved recovery of superficial retinal vascular density in these areas. Functionally, the short-term group showed better BCVA and retinal sensitivity both before and 1mo after SOR; additionally, the P100 amplitude in VEP tests was significantly increased in this group. CONCLUSION: Shortening the duration of silicone oil tamponade effectively reduces damage to retinal structure and function without compromising the success rate of retinal reattachment in patients with primary RRD.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis pengaruh biaya produksi, kredit mikro, dan stabilitas harga terhadap pendapatan petani padi di Kecamatan Buer, Kabupaten Sumbawa Besar. Sektor pertanian, khususnya komoditas padi, merupakan sumber utama mata pencaharian masyarakat di wilayah ini, namun pendapatan petani masih menghadapi berbagai tantangan akibat tingginya biaya produksi, keterbatasan akses permodalan, serta fluktuasi harga gabah. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan kuantitatif dengan metode asosiatif. Data diperoleh melalui penyebaran kuesioner kepada 100 petani padi sebagai responden yang dipilih menggunakan teknik sampling. Analisis data dilakukan dengan regresi linier berganda setelah melalui uji validitas, reliabilitas, dan uji asumsi klasik. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa secara simultan biaya produksi, kredit mikro, dan stabilitas harga berpengaruh signifikan terhadap pendapatan petani padi. Secara parsial, biaya produksi dan stabilitas harga berpengaruh positif dan signifikan terhadap pendapatan petani, sedangkan kredit mikro tidak berpengaruh signifikan. Temuan ini mengindikasikan bahwa pengelolaan biaya produksi yang efisien serta stabilitas harga gabah menjadi faktor penting dalam meningkatkan pendapatan petani padi. Sementara itu, efektivitas kredit mikro masih perlu ditingkatkan agar benar-benar berfungsi sebagai modal produktif bagi petani. Penelitian ini diharapkan dapat menjadi bahan pertimbangan bagi pemerintah daerah dan pihak terkait dalam merumuskan kebijakan peningkatan kesejahteraan petani padi secara berkelanjutan. </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To compare the tear film quantity and stability parameters in keratoconus (KCN) and normal eyes using test breakup time (TBUT), noninvasive TBUT (NITBUT), and Schirmer test. METHODS: All participants (n=166), including patients with KCN and age-matched healthy individuals with normal corneas, were recruited from those referred to Farabi Eye Hospital, Iran, in 2023. To better account for genetic and environmental factors, the control group comprised healthy individuals who were relatives of KCN patients and had normal corneal topography. Tear quantity parameters were evaluated in the following order: NITBUT, TBUT, and Schirmer tests. RESULTS: The mean age of cases in KCN (61.7% males) and normal (63.5% males) participants was 27.54±5.44y (range 19 to 38) and 27.52±5.63y (range 20 to 38), respectively (P=0.976). NIBUT, TBUT, and Schirmer’s tests were significantly lower in KCN group compared to normal controls (all P&lt;0.001). The mean difference for NIBUT was -7.81s (P&lt;0.001), and for TBUT was -7.61s (P&lt;0.001). Schirmer test values were also significantly lower in the KCN group, with a mean difference of -5.61 mm compared to normal people (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate significant tear film impairment in KCN. The reductions in NIBUT, TBUT and Schirmer scores highlight an underlying tear film dysfunction in KCN that extends beyond the morphological changes of the cornea.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) in individuals experiencing total hip arthroplasty (THA) is related to a substantially higher fall risk, length of post-operative hospital in-patient stay, elevated implant-related adverse events, and earlier revision. Therefore, it is essential to try to avoid LLD when implanting a THA. Several studies focus on this issue, including the following: Accelerometer-based portable navigation system, preoperative digital templating, robot-assisted surgery, the anatomical marker positioning method (shoulder-to-shoulder) and the artificial intelligence-based three-dimensional planning software system. The aforementioned methods should be familiar to surgeons who perform THA procedures, as a fundamental objective of this surgical intervention is to avoid LLD.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To explore the causal relationship between several possible behavioral factors and high myopia (HM) using multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) approach and to find the mediators among them with mediation analysis. METHODS: The causal effects of several behavioral factors, including screen time, education time, time spent outdoors, and physical activity, on the risk of HM using univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) and MVMR analyses were first assessed. Genome-wide association study summary statistics of serum metabolites were also used in mediation analysis to determine the extent to which serum metabolites mediate the effects of behavioral factors on HM. RESULTS: MR analyses indicated that both increased time spent outdoors and a higher frequency of moderate physical activity significantly reduced the risk of HM. Further MVMR analysis confirmed that moderate physical activity independently contributed to a lower risk of HM. Additionally, MR analyses identified 13 serum metabolites significantly associated with HM, of which 12 were lipids and one was an amino acid derivative. Mediation analysis revealed that six lipid metabolites mediated the protective effects of moderate physical activity on HM, with the highest mediation proportion observed for 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-GPC (p-16:0; 30.83%). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in addition to outdoor time, moderate physical activity habits may have an independent protective effect against HM and pointed to lipid metabolites as priority targets for the prevention due to low physical activity. These results emphasize the importance of physical activity and metabolic health in HM and underscore the need for further study of these complex associations.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>BACKGROUND</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Orthopaedic surgical education has traditionally depended on the apprenticeship model of “see one, do one, teach one”. However, reduced operative exposure, stricter work-hour regulations, medicolegal constraints, and patient safety concerns have constrained its practicality. Simulation-based training has become a reliable, safe, and cost-efficient alternative. Dry lab techniques, especially virtual and augmented reality, make up 78% of current dry lab research, whereas wet labs still set the standard for anatomical realism.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>AIM</jats:p>                   <jats:p>To evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and future directions of wet and dry lab simulation in orthopaedic training.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>METHODS</jats:p>                   <jats:p>A scoping review was carried out across four databases-PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost-up to 2025. Medical Subject Headings included: "Orthopaedic Education", "Wet Lab", "Dry Lab", "Simulation Training", "Virtual Reality", and "Surgical Procedure". Eligible studies focused on orthopaedic or spinal surgical education, employed wet or dry lab techniques, and assessed training effectiveness. Exclusion criteria consisted of non-English publications, abstracts only, non-orthopaedic research, and studies unrelated to simulation. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving discrepancies with a third reviewer.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>RESULTS</jats:p>                   <jats:p>From 1851 records, 101 studies met inclusion: 78 on dry labs, 7 on wet labs, 4 on both. Virtual reality (VR) simulations were most common, with AI increasingly used for feedback and assessment. Cadaveric training remains the gold standard for accuracy and tactile feedback, while dry labs-especially VR-offer scalability, lower cost (40%-60% savings in five studies), and accessibility for novices. Senior residents prefer wet labs for complex tasks; juniors favour dry labs for basics. Challenges include limited transferability data, lack of standard outcome metrics, and ethical concerns about cadaver use and AI assessment.</jats:p>                   <jats:p>CONCLUSION</jats:p>                   <jats:p>Wet and dry labs each have unique strengths in orthopaedic training. A hybrid approach combining both, supported by standardised assessments and outcome studies, is most effective. Future efforts should aim for uniform reporting, integrating new technologies, and policy support for hybrid curricula to enhance skills and patient care.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Penelitian ini untuk melihat Pengaruh Indeks Pembangunan Manusia, Pengangguran Dan Ketimpangan Pendapatan Terhadap Kemiskinan Di Indonesia Tahun 2015-2024. Pada penelitian ini menggunakan sensus atau sampling total yang merupakan teknik pengambilan sampel dengan cara menggunakan seluruh anggota populasi sebagai sampel. Kriteria sampel yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah seluruh populasi yaitu 34 provinsi di Indonesia pada tahun 2015 hingga 2024. Penelitian ini menggunakan teknik analisis regresi data panel. Dapat ditarik kesimpulan sebagai berikut: (a)Indeks Pembangunan Manusia secara signifikan terbukti dapat menurunkan kemiskinan di Indonesia pada tahun 2015-2024. Dimana peningkatan IPM melalui pendidikan, kesehatan dan standar hidup yang layak dapat menciptakan efek yang positif yaitu dapat membuat masyarakat lebih sehat dan terdidik sehingga akan lebih produktif, dapat mandiri secara ekonomi, dan pada akhirnya dapat mampu keluar dari jerat kemiskinan secara permanen; (b) Pengangguran belum terbukti dapat mengurangi kemiskinan di Indonesia pada tahun 2015-2024. Hal ini didukung dengan fenomena working poor (pekerja miskin) di mana kemiskinan tidak disebabkan oleh ketiadaan pekerjaan, melainkan oleh rendahnya kualitas pekerjaan. Kebijakan pengentasan kemiskinan tidak cukup hanya berfokus pada penurunan tingkat pengangguran, tetapi juga perlu diarahkan pada peningkatan kualitas pekerjaan dan perluasan kapabilitas ekonomi masyarakat; dan (c) Ketimpangan Pendapatan merupakan determinan penting yang berpengaruh signifikan terhadap tingkat kemiskinan di Indonesia. Kebijakan yang mendorong pemerataan pendapatan serta perluasan akses terhadap sumber daya ekonomi terbukti dapat menekan tingkat kemiskinan secara berkelanjutan  </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of decellularized conjunctival stroma (DCS) as a novel biomaterial by comparing its grafting outcomes with amniotic membrane (AM) when used for conjunctival reconstruction after primary pterygium excision. METHODS: This randomized, parallel-controlled study with allocation concealment enrolled 40 patients with primary pterygium. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups using the sealed envelope method: the DCS group (n=20) and the AM group (n=18), receiving DCS and AM grafts respectively. Slit-lamp photography of the operative eyes was performed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30, 90, and 180d postoperatively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and symptom scores were recorded simultaneously. In vivo confocal microscopy was conducted at 3 and 6mo postoperatively. RESULTS: All participants exhibited improved postoperative symptoms. The mean age was 60±9y (male/female ratio: 6/14) in the DCS group and 56±12y (male/female ratio: 7/11) in the AM group. The average epithelial healing time was 9.89±3.54d in the DCS group and 8.17±1.34d in the AM group (P=0.084). One recurrence case was observed in each group. Postoperative graft hemorrhage was significantly more severe in the DCS group than in the AM group only at 30d postoperatively (P=0.011). In vivo confocal microscopy revealed conjunctival epithelial cell growth in both groups at 90d postoperatively, while clear corneo-conjunctival cell boundaries were observed until 180d postoperatively. CONCLUSION: DCS used in primary pterygium surgery has a safety profile comparable to AM. It promotes rapid postoperative conjunctival healing, achieves a relatively low pterygium recurrence rate, and yields outcomes similar to AM. DCS provides a novel biomaterial option for conjunctival reconstruction after pterygium excision and the treatment of other conjunctival injuries.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Complex trimalleolar ankle fractures are a major orthopaedic challenge, with an incidence of 4.22 per 10000 person-years in the United States and an annual cost of 3.4 billion dollars. This review synthesizes current evidence on diagnostic protocols and management strategies, highlighting optimal approaches and emerging trends. Initial care emphasizes soft tissue assessment, often guided by the Tscherne classification, and fracture classification systems. External fixation may be required in open injuries, while early open reduction and internal fixation within six days is linked to improved outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques for the lateral malleolus, including intramedullary nailing and locking plates, are effective, while medial malleolus fractures are commonly managed with screw fixation or tension-band wiring. Posterior malleolus fragments involving more than 25% of the articular surface usually warrant fixation. Alternatives to syndesmotic screws, such as cortical buttons or high-strength sutures, reduce the need for secondary procedures. Arthroscopic-assisted open reduction and internal fixation benefits younger, active patients by enabling concurrent management of intra-articular and ligamentous injuries. Postoperative care prioritizes early weight-bearing and validated functional scores. Despite advances, complications remain common, and further research is needed to refine surgical strategies and improve outcomes.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of combined phacoemulsification with intravitreal dexamethasone implant (DEX-I) versus anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and visually significant cataract. METHODS: This nonrandomized, retrospective analysis included 54 eyes undergoing phacoemulsification with DEX-I (DEX-I group) and 47 eyes receiving anti-VEGF injections (anti-VEGF group). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) were measured preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 and 3mo. RESULTS: The two groups had comparable baseline characteristics, with similar age (DEX-I: 66.83±7.27y; anti-VEGF: 66.81±6.79y) and gender distribution (51.9% vs 59.6% males). Both groups showed significant BCVA improvement at 1 and 3mo, with no significant intergroup differences. CMT reduction was significantly greater in the DEX-I group at 3mo (25.03% vs 14.07%; P=0.049), particularly in recalcitrant eyes (25.09% vs 11.10%; P=0.007). Postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP)&gt;21 mm Hg was observed in 14.8% of DEX-I eyes and 4.25% of anti-VEGF eyes (P=0.08), normalizing by 3mo. DEX-I required no reinjection, while 29.79% of anti-VEGF eyes needed a fourth dose at 3mo. Complications were minimal, with one posterior capsular injury in the DEX-I group. CONCLUSION: Combined phacoemulsification with intravitreal DEX-I offers superior CMT reduction and comparable visual acuity improvement to anti-VEGF injections in DME, with fewer required treatments. It is an effective strategy for managing cataract with DME, offering benefits, especially for recalcitrant cases. Both therapies have favourable safety profiles, but further long-term studies are needed for clinical guidance.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: To conduct a genetic analysis of Han-Chinese patients with isolated congenital ptosis (ICP) and identify the genetic variants related to the condition. METHODS: Sixty-five unrelated patients with ICP were enrolled. Comprehensive clinical examinations, whole exome sequencing (WES), and Sanger sequencing were used to reveal the potential genetic causes. Combined with public and in-house control databases, multiple bioinformatics prediction tools, and conservation analysis, the potential variants were further analyzed. AlphaFold 3, an accurate modelling prediction tool, was utilized to generate three-dimensional structural models of both wild-type and mutated proteins. RESULTS: Three novel heterozygous variants in the zinc finger homeobox 4 gene (ZFHX4), c.5145C&gt;A (p.N1715K), c.10382C&gt;T (p.A3461V), and c.10795G&gt;A (p.A3599T), were identified in three patients, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that these variants are likely to exert deleterious effects, supporting their potential involvement in the pathogenesis of ptosis. CONCLUSION: The novel heterozygous ZFHX4 variants are identified as disease-associated variants in three patients with ptosis, suggesting that ZFHX4 may be a disease-causing gene for autosomal dominant ICP with incomplete penetrance or a susceptibility gene. These findings expand the variant spectrum of ZFHX4, improve understanding of the pathogenesis of ZFHX4-related ptosis, and may contribute to the genetic counseling and disease management, as well as the development of experimental treatments.</jats:p>
