  - 摘要：<jats:p>Water scarcity and ineffective water management remain demanding global challenges, particularly in regions where manual monitoring methods dominate. This study presents the conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based water-level monitoring system to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of water resource management. The designed system integrates ultrasonic sensors, low-power microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules connected to a cloud-based platform for real-time data acquisition. Using IoT technology, the system provides accurate, timely water-level information, enabling informed decision-making and proactive management. It incorporates sensors, wireless communication, data analytics, and visualisation techniques to optimise water use, detect anomalies, and allow remote monitoring. By providing continuous, precise measurements, the system enhances decision-making across areas such as flood control, irrigation scheduling, and reservoir management. The system is scalable, adaptable, and cost-effective, making it ideal for residential, commercial, and agricultural water systems. The integration of IoT technology has the potential to transform water resource management practices and support long-term water conservation efforts.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The Balanced Scorecard was designed following the McKinsey model,  with the aim of implementing a systematic process involving the  management, administrative, and teaching staff, comprised of a total of  47 participants [sample]. Thanks to this tool, the institutional planning  model was improved, emphasizing both an internal and external analysis  of the school context, while also considering the previously established  vision, mission, and values. Strategic indicators related to revenue and  profitability, as well as objectives, responsibilities, and measurement  mechanisms, were defined. Although the research did not consider  evaluating a full implementation period, the adoption of disciplined  management was recommended to consolidate a culture of monitoring  and measurement at the school. In the future, the BSC approach could be  expanded to incorporate additional sectoral and financial indicators, with  the aim of enabling the institution to achieve broader objectives.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>In Mexico the most common disability is motor impairment, people in wheelchairs  have muscle pain, reduced gastric motility and blood circulation problems. To  mitigate them, standing devices have been developed to put the patient in an upright  position, which are manufactured with simple mechanical elements or equipped  with high technology. The vertical position helps to improve blood circulation in  the legs, promote gastric motility, decreases muscle atrophy among others. In this  work a voice-controlled standing system is developed, it has two motors for  forward, backward, left and right movement and two linear actuators to raise the  patient to a standing position. An ESP32 is the equipment controller, receives  commands via Bluetooth from a smartphone App developed in App Inventor and  activates or deactivates motors or linear actuators. The commands used are UP,  Down, Left, Right, Forward, Backward and Stop.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The popular legislative initiative serves as a complementary mechanism of citizen participation within the framework of representative democracy, intended to strengthen the relationship between government and citizens by enabling the submission of proposals for laws or decrees. Nevertheless, its implementation at the federal level in Mexico continues to face significant obstacles: the legal requirements are burdensome, the effective influence of individuals on the legislative process remains limited, and its practical use has been minimal more than a decade after its incorporation into the Constitution. This study examines the legal structure of this mechanism and offers an empirical assessment based on data concerning initiatives submitted to the Houses of Congress.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The rise of digital transformation in higher education underscores the significance of digital literacy; nevertheless, previous studies have frequently investigated its technical and psychological features separately, leaving insufficient analysis of how these aspects jointly enable academic outcomes and overlooking critical drawbacks alongside its benefits. By reviewing secondary sources, the article highlights that the core dimensions of digital literacy include access to information and communication technology, conceptual skills, and operational competencies. Additionally, the article shows that digital literacy plays an essential role in enhancing student engagement, encompassing cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement, providing learning flexibility, and fostering academic performance. However, digital literacy also leaves the relevant drawbacks beyond its potential, such as over-reliance on digital applications, breaches of academic ethics, and distraction to students' academic concentration. This review article emphasizes that digital literacy serves as a means for students' performance and professional development in the higher education landscape. Overall, this review demonstrates the progressive transformation of digital literacy and its consequences for higher education institutions in equipping learners for effective performance and satisfied learning outcomes in a continuously technological world.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The objective of this research is to analyze the operational, economic,  and social feasibility of implementing Point of Sale Terminals (POS) in  businesses established within the Tecamac Supply Center, State of  Mexico. A mixed approach was used, collecting quantitative data (direct  surveys) and qualitative data (observation and document analysis). It was  identified that 65% of tenants already use some POS or digital payments,  with non-bank terminals being the most common Clip, Zettle, Mercado  Pago, and Billpocket are most popular due to their low entry cost, ease  of use, mobility, and lack of formal tax requirements. Bank POS  terminals, such as BBVA, Banorte, Banamex, and Intercam, are used less  frequently but represent a solution with greater institutional support and  security levels. From a cost perspective, it was concluded that non-bank  POS terminals are affordable, with prices ranging from $300 to $2,000  MXN, with no fixed monthly fees. Bank-owned POS terminals, which  cost more than $4,000 MXN and carry lower monthly rentals and  transaction fees. The study demonstrates that implementing POS  terminals in the Tecamac Supply Center is technically feasible,  economically profitable, and socially relevant.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This paper investigates the features of self-attitude and perceptions of ideal beauty among young women with negative and positive perceptions of their own appearance. The problem of body and appearance dissatisfaction deserves close attention due to its high prevalence and profound destructive effects. It directly undermines the psychological well-being of young women, being a cause of not only low self-esteem and negative self-perception but also maladaptive behavioral strategies. The empirical study involved 50 young women aged 20–34. The method of projective storytelling was used as the primary research technique. The processing of respondents’ narratives was conducted using content analysis and Fisher’s angular transformation. A comparative analysis of perceptions of ideal beauty revealed that for the group of young women dissatisfied with their appearance, a focus on external attributes (such as attractive facial features and a perfect body) is characteristic, as well as heightened sensitivity to issues of gender discrimination based on appearance. At the same time, young women with a positive perception of their appearance were significantly more likely to associate the concept of beauty with the development of spiritual potential. This indicates that acceptance of one’s own appearance provides freedom from stereotypical beauty standards, opening the way for a deeper and more meaningful self-perception. The results of the study demonstrate that a negative body image acts not as an isolated problem but as a complex factor deforming the holistic system of self-attitude in young women.</jats:p>
