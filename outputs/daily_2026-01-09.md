  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>The introduction foregrounds the contemporary experience of gridded infrastructure in Northern California, where wildfires can be caused by the electric grid, where gas appliances are being phased out, and where there is an ongoing concern with seismic activity. It introduces a number of the concepts central to Warner’s lectures and the three responses to them: the question of agency in relation to climate change, the relationship between gridded infrastructure and the awareness of energy consumption, what it means to be a “user” of gridded energy, the meaningfulness of the collective, and what “ethicalized awareness” of our relationship to the grid might consist of.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>This lecture explores traditions of thinking (including figures such as Thoreau, Mumford, and Heidegger) that confront the de-ethicalizing effects of infrastructure. It traces an opposition between, on the one hand, forms of thought invested in a utopia of unlimited energy with no self-limiting principle, where users can indulge in maximal demand with minimal awareness, and, on the other hand, an ethical tradition of awareness of the conditions of existence for which the scale of use of resources involves a relationship to need. Taking up this Thoreauvian ethical tradition, offgrid countercultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s exemplified an ethical and political vision that would motivate distributed and renewable power, scaled to use. Of late, however, an investment in alternative energy has been decoupled from its countercultural politics, leading to the concerning prospect of an ever more enveloping grid modernity in which ethicalized awareness will have ever less scope.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>This response describes governance in today’s world, that of the grid and of immense investments in infrastructure, one in which governance eclipses sovereignty, stakeholders replace citizens, and networks overgrow territories, thereby creating problems for political action, precisely because these forms of ordering are forms of antipolitics. One interesting possibility discussed is that of “the hack,” a way of remaking a world by subterfuge, pursuing system-level agency in the absence of the political capacity to act at the scale that generates, sustains, and amends the system. Localism is also considered but is taken to be a luxury: Anyone attempting to leave behind the large systems of twenty-first-century sovereignty and governance will ineluctably be drawn back into them. Collective action is in the end still necessary, requiring a way of combining the vividness of vision of dissenting prophets and communities with the reach and power that only sovereign action can achieve.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>This commentary examines Warner’s concept of “ethicalized awareness” (a mode of life that involves appreciating nature in ways that are becoming lost and instrumentalized), situating it within the history of American environmentalism. Such awareness is associated with a sense of agency (e.g., the consumer boycotts of CFC-propelled spray cans). Yet there is also something like “management without ethics” (e.g., the technocratic processes that were also crucial to preserving the ozone layer). One sees competing “premodern” and “postmodern” tendencies within today’s environmentalism, corresponding to a tension between appreciating nature and using it efficiently. Ultimately a picture that views individual people as the primary protagonists is taken to be more natural to the climate change story than one that sees it as a problem in search of a solution from economics and technology. Acting on “green virtues,” including respect for nature, stands as an important step toward the recovery (or reconception) of agency.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>This paper attempts to resolve an exegetical tension in the debate on Nietzsche’s conception of value by arguing the following claims. First, he is a kind of moderate pluralist about value who uses the “thriving/degeneration of life” or “increase/decrease in power” as a quantitative covering value for a plurality of drives with qualitatively different and irreducible objects of value. Second, he has a determinate evaluative scheme for “revaluating” or “rank ordering” the plurality of drives by differentiating between their contribution to the covering value in two ways. One way is by differentiating between a plurality of “instinctive” drives for objects with intrinsic/necessary value and a plurality of “non-instinctive” drives for objects with extrinsic/possible value. Another way is by differentiating between the plurality of drives in instances of conflict or comparison between their objects of value. The paper justifies the exegetical validity of this scheme by demonstrating its ability to reconcile some of Nietzsche’s seemingly paradoxical evaluative remarks pertaining to the truth/falsity of morality and the value of the truth/falsity for morality, ascetic ideals as both an affirmation and negation of life, and all values as both expressing and lacking the will to power.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                <jats:p>In response to the preceding commentaries, this contribution restates the ways in which environmentalism’s hopes, for better or worse, are being recalibrated to the realities of decarbonization. There has recently been an uptick in the number of people arguing that the real problem is not First World excesses of consumption, but rather the mentality of energy scarcity, of conservation, and even efficiency. The imagined utopia of unlimited energy remains vivid for such people. This underscores how grid-mediated energy has moved the world beyond the order in which technology was a means to an end. Drawing on observations by the three commentators, Warner asks again why something like the ethicalized awareness of environmentalism (so challenged by the presences of the grid) should remain important and concludes that the utopia of grid-mediated green energy challenges, but does not entirely foreclose, new kinds of collective deliberation and adaptation.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study discusses the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based weather chatbot dashboard capable of receiving natural Indonesian language queries and displaying weather information interactively. The system combines Sentence-BERT (SBERT) paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 as a text similarity engine, Gemini 2.5-flash Large Language Model (LLM) as a natural language summary generator, and the OpenWeather API as a real-time weather data source. A zero-shot semantic similarity approach is used without fine-tuning, with intent determination based on cosine similarity and a threshold of 0.5 optimized through testing several threshold values. The development method used is the Waterfall model with stages of requirements analysis, architectural design, NLP module implementation and API integration, React dashboard frontend development, as well as functional black-box testing and performance metric evaluation. The test results show that SBERT with a threshold of 0.5 produces an intent classification accuracy of 90% in 20 test scenarios, which increases to 100% after being combined with rule-based auto-adjust and fallback mechanisms. City entity extraction with a 1–3 word sliding window against city.list.json achieved 100% accuracy on 15 city-based queries, while macro metrics yielded a precision of 0.9286, a recall of 0.90, and an F1‑score of 0.8958. The integration of the OpenWeather API and Gemini enables the presentation of natural, informative weather summaries and visualization of real-time weather data in the form of interactive graphs on a React-based dashboard.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Chapter 2 investigates further the role of anniversaries in activism by studying the tenacity of the radical calendar as an activist cultural form with roots in the republican calendars of the French Revolution. Adducing examples from the late eighteenth century to the present, and from wall calendars and almanacs to pocket-sized agendas, it shows how activists have sought to establish a new sociotemporal order by setting up an alternative canon of events and figures to be commemorated across the year. Anniversaries are an important tool for keeping alive the memory of hope in periods of abeyance if only in the hearts and minds of individuals through their daily exposure to pocket-sized diaries. Moreover, in the form of public commemorations, anniversaries can have a contentious edge by activating the possibility, both for activists and security forces, that a movement can be kick-started again. While anniversaries answer to a cyclical notion of time, they can always turn into event-like occasions that open unpredictable possibilities.</jats:p>

- **Surgically Oriented Ultrasound-Based AI of Median Nerve Morphology as a Decision Support for Carpal Tunnel Release: A Calibrated ConvNeXt-CBAM Framework With Supervised Contrastive Warm-Up**

  - 摘要：<jats:p>AIM: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compressive neuropathy commonly encountered in hand surgery, and decisions regarding whether operative decompression should be conducted rely on accuracy and clinical interpretability of imaging findings. Ultrasound is commonly used to directly visualize the median nerve in this condition, but remains operator-dependent and is limited by inconsistent diagnostic thresholds. This study aimed to develop a surgically oriented ultrasound-based artificial intelligence (AI) model that provides strong discriminative power, reliable probability calibration for preoperative counseling, and anatomy-aware explainability aligned with the nerve targeted in carpal tunnel release. METHODS: In this retrospective study, adults with suspected CTS, who had ultrasound image of adequate quality and met criteria for the clinical standard, were included; cases with prior carpal tunnel surgery or non-diagnostic images were excluded. We analyzed 2900 wrist ultrasound examinations, reserving an a priori 20% test set (n = 580 images) at the patient level. DenseNet-121 was utilized as the reference baseline. The proposed model used ConvNeXt-T augmented with Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM), optimized with a supervised contrastive warm-up before standard fine-tuning; probabilities were post-hoc calibrated by temperature scaling. Images underwent de-identification, normalization, and ultrasound-appropriate augmentation. Primary outcome was discrimination (receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), average precision (AP)) with bootstrap bands; secondary outcomes included accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), confusion matrices, probability distributions, class-conditional score separation, and Grad-CAM++ agreement with expert-defined regions of interest. Test set labels used a fixed 0.5 threshold. RESULTS: The proposed model outperformed the baseline in terms of discrimination (AUC 0.904 vs 0.821; AP 0.907 vs 0.831). Aggregate metrics also favored the proposed approach (accuracy 0.91 vs 0.83; precision 0.89 vs 0.81; recall 0.88 vs 0.82; F1 score 0.88 vs 0.81). Confusion matrices showed concurrent reductions in false positives (58\rightarrow33, –43%) and false negatives (52\rightarrow35, –33%): baseline true-negatives (TN)/false-positives (FP)/false-negatives (FN)/true-positives (TP) = 232/58/52/238; proposed TN/FP/FN/TP = 257/33/35/255. Predicted-probability histograms and class-conditional densities indicated more confident, better-separated outputs with calibration. Grad-CAM++ overlays were more compact and nerve-concordant relative to expert contours, supporting anatomy-aligned interpretability for surgical planning. CONCLUSIONS: A calibrated, explainable ConvNeXt-CBAM ultrasound classifier delivers reliable probabilities and anatomically faithful saliency that are directly actionable for surgical triage, timing of decompression, and preoperative counseling in CTS. These findings support ultrasound-based AI as a practical adjunct to clinical assessment and nerve conduction studies in hand surgery, warranting prospective, multicenter validation and workflow integration.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The purpose of the research is to analyze the contribution of health communication toward public awareness and behavioral change in stunting prevention in Laweyan Sub-District. The focus of the research will be oriented toward the change in knowledge, attitude, and practice on balanced nutrition, accounting consumption of junk food. The study applied a qualitative case study design that included respondents who were health officers, posyandu cadres, community leaders, and households of beneficiaries. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and observations, and documentation. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The results showed that health communication strategies in Laweyan used face-to-face counseling, digital media, and innovatively, Secating and Dasyat as the programs that increase the community understanding of balanced nutrition. However, effectiveness was reduced by low awareness of nutrition (about 45% of respondents did not consider themselves to have heard of balanced nutrition), lack of time by community members to attend counseling events, and lack of communication facilities at the sub-district level. Thus, more participatory communication strategies are required that involve local opinion leaders and strengthen community-based communication media for health messages that are easier to accept and apply to their daily lives.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This Community Service (PkM) program was motivated by the low early reading ability of grade 1 students and limited digital literacy skills of grade 5 students at SDN Curahdami 2, Bondowoso, which affected their learning process and readiness for the Computer-Based National Assessment (ANBK). The program aimed to improve pre-literacy, beginning reading skills, and digital literacy through structured ANBK training activities. The implementation methods included initial observation, intensive mentoring, and hands-on practice conducted over seven weeks using letter tables, reading modules, phonics cards, ANBK practice modules, and digital devices such as laptops and mobile phones. Participants consisted of 16 students, including 7 students from grade 1 and 9 students from grade 5. Evaluation employed a one-group pre–post design to measure changes after the intervention. The results showed improvements in grade 1 students’ pre-literacy skills, with letter recognition increasing from 8% to 48%, differentiation between uppercase and lowercase letters from 5% to 42%, and word copying skills from 10% to 40%, although beginning reading ability remained relatively low (from 5% to 16%). For grade 5 students, the average digital literacy score increased from 32 to 58, the proportion of students able to complete ANBK practice packages rose from 5% to 35%, and overall learning mastery improved from 8% to 38%. These findings indicate that mentoring-based ANBK training within a community service framework is effective in strengthening basic literacy and digital literacy foundations and improving elementary school students’ readiness for computer-based assessments.</jats:p>

Education is seen as a process that allows a person to grow and develop their potential. According to Ki Hajar Dewantara, education aims to advance the development of the child's character, mind and body. Education has a big role in producing quality human resources and being able to compete healthily. Elementary school (SD) is an educational institution that teaches the basics of intelligence, knowledge, personality, noble character, and life skills to develop potential and prepare students to continue their education to a higher level. In this context, SD Negeri Penambangan in Curahdami sub-district, Bondowoso district was chosen to implement a social project for the Pancasila Education course. The school has limited access, a less strategic location, and a small number of students, 47 students with an average class size of less than 10. Some students also do not understand basic reading, writing and arithmetic. In addition, many of them do not eat breakfast before going to school and buy unhealthy snacks, such as fried foods and packaged drinks, during break time. The project was carried out in four stages: planning, survey, implementation and closure, with the aim of providing students with an understanding of the importance of a healthy diet and balanced nutrition. The material delivery that we use such as direct material exposure, Video playback of material, reading and writing, practice doing hand washing activities, and building puzzles. At the end of the activity, it is expected that students not only understand the theory of balanced nutrition, but also can apply it in everyday life, both at home and at school. Teachers and parents are expected to support students in choosing healthy food, and schools can create a culture of healthy living that supports students' health and learning achievement. Thus, students are expected to grow into healthy, smart, and productive individuals.</jats:p>
