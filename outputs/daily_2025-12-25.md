To address the performance degradation of point cloud object detection in foggy conditions, this paper aims to propose an efficient dynamic pillar-based point cloud detection network tailored for foggy traffic scenarios.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The point cloud data are first pillarized, and then the model adaptively adjusts the feature extraction process through DynamicPillarVFE to significantly enhance the processing capability for sparse and irregular point cloud data. Second, a bird's eye view (BEV) backbone network based on residual connections is used to effectively mitigate the gradient vanishing problem in deep networks. In addition, this paper introduces Triplet Attention (TA) in the feature enhancement part, which can focus on important features more comprehensively and suppress noise interference.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>In this paper, we mixed a small portion of the Multifog KITTI dataset on top of the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that under moderate difficulty 3D evaluation metrics, our method achieves accuracy improvements of 5.03%, 6.66% and 7.78% for cars, pedestrians and cyclists, respectively, compared to the PointPillars baseline, significantly enhancing point cloud object detection performance in foggy conditions. Furthermore, the DPSF-Net architecture achieves an inference speed of 32.36 ms per frame, fully meeting the real-time processing requirements for autonomous driving applications.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This method is more economical to simulate the influence of sensors under foggy conditions, and through the training of mixed data sets, the network model can better cope with foggy interference.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The digitalization perspective becomes mandatory for understanding any social transformations. Understanding the digitalization priorities in the context of reintegration processes in Ukraine is in the plane of understanding the global, regional, European and domestic trends in the informatization, which affect the information society. Given the trends in information development that dominate modern human life, information reintegration will constitute a system-forming component of the state policy of reintegration and the foundation for its deployment in other areas, and will also determine its systematicity, efficiency and sustainability of results. The information reintegration is manifested in people-centeredness, adherence to the Ukraine's national interests and European democratic and legal ideals, balance with the unique needs of certain categories of Ukrainians that require reintegration, as well as in the compliance of the forms and means of implementing this policy with the technological development level of information society.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This study explores the strategic implications of identifying and analyzing patterns in deviant phenomena across various domains. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, including Benford's Law analysis, Bayesian networks, and extreme value theory, we uncover hidden regularities in seemingly random or anomalous events. Our research demonstrates how these patterns can be utilized to inform decision-making processes and shape effective strategies in fields such as fraud detection, risk management, and human rights monitoring. The study presents a novel framework for integrating statistical anomaly detection with strategic planning, allowing organizations to proactively address potential threats and opportunities. Our findings suggest that a deeper understanding of deviant patterns can lead to more robust and adaptive strategies, particularly in complex and uncertain environments. This work contributes to the growing body of literature on data-driven strategy formulation and offers practical insights for policymakers and business leaders.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global norms, revealing both systemic flaws and new efficiencies, chief among them the shift to remote work. As businesses moved online, traditional boundaries between public and private life, and fixed working hours blurred. While employees are expected to work toward organizational goals, remote settings call for a reassessment of rights and obligations of both the employer and employee, considering the nature and location of work. Dress codes, historically tied to professionalism, safety, and branding, are now being reexamined in light of evolving freedoms of religion and expression. Clothing, as a form of personal identity, gains stronger protection within one's home. As virtual workspaces become the norm, this article traces the jurisprudence behind the enforcement of dress codes and whether that enforcement holds valid in an online workplace.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and Stargardt disease, are primary contributors to irreversible vision loss globally. Due to the scarcity of effective curative treatments, stem cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary advancement in ophthalmology. In the last ten years, significant advancements have been achieved in the derivation of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor precursors from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, with initial clinical trials indicating safety and potential efficacy. Innovative delivery platforms, such as biodegradable scaffolds, microcarrier suspensions, and minimally invasive subretinal devices, are tackling prior challenges related to cell survival and integration. Simultaneously, gene-edited and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells are positioned to surmount immunological and ethical constraints. Future combinatorial strategies that incorporate stem cells with gene therapy, CRISPR-mediated editing, and bioengineered retinal organoids offer potential for personalized and regenerative methodologies. Nonetheless, enduring functional integration, immune tolerance, and oncogenic safety continue to pose significant challenges. To effectively transition from laboratory research to clinical application, collaborative frameworks among academic institutions, biotechnology companies, and regulatory agencies will be crucial for unlocking the complete therapeutic potential of stem cell-based treatments for retinal diseases. Stem cell therapy has transitioned from a distant promise to an advancing reality set to transform retinal care.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Purpose. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the amber market and identify the key principles of the gemological classification of raw amber. This will provide complete information on the quality of amber and its consumer properties, which, in turn, will create the basis for solving both practical and theoretical tasks: determining the cost of raw materials and finished products; identifying patterns of development of the amber market.   Methodology. The methodological basis of the study is based on general scientific analytical approaches. Within the framework of the methodology, a classification algorithm has been developed that allows building a relational database with the ability to automate, systematise, analyse and visualise information on the basis of specialised software.   Findings. On the basis of the developed classification principles, three categories of properties have been identified: dimensional and weight, technological and decorative, and decorative ones. They are key in determining the quality of amber, drawing up geological, economic, technological and design projects. This approach made it possible to develop a gemological classification that has been tested on specific sites, which, in turn, contributed to the creation of a software algorithm that simplifies the work of geologists, miners, and processors.   Originality. For the first time, the basic principles of the gemological classification have been developed, taking into account the fundamental principles of gemological science, design, processing and evaluation of amber.   Practical value. The amber quality criteria included in the gemological classification are important for the geological and economic assessment of amber deposits, the preparation of price lists taking into account consumer properties, the development of technological projects, and the analysis of the raw amber market.</jats:p>

This method is based on a systematic approach that tracks the relative importance weights of the different evaluation criteria.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The research yielded a 3-level structure with 15 indicators, revealing the relative importance weights via the SWARA method. The relationships between these 3 levels (low to high) revealed 96 interconnected networks. Their relative scores clarified the differences between all criteria and network items, directing the actions to be taken for accessibility. Accordingly, the accessibility potential of educational buildings can be measured with the importance weights of these network items, guiding the development and implementation of more effective accessibility standards.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The study presents an innovative ranking methodology for architects and users to monitor the extent of accessibility principles and criteria and provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the accessibility potential of educational buildings.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<ns3:p>Easy-to-use libraries such as scikit-learn have accelerated the adoption and application of machine learning (ML) workflows and data-driven methods. While many of the algorithms implemented in these libraries originated in specific scientific fields, they have gained in popularity in part because of their generalisability across multiple domains. Over the past two decades, researchers in the chemical and materials science community have put forward general-purpose machine learning methods. The deployment of these methods into workflows of other domains, however, is often burdensome due to the entanglement with domain-specific functionalities. We present the python library scikit-matter that targets domain-agnostic implementations of methods developed in the computational chemical and materials science community, following the scikit-learn API and coding guidelines to promote usability and interoperability with existing workflows.</ns3:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Purpose. To conduct a multi-criteria evaluation and analysis of the performance of encryption algorithms that may be potentially resistant to contemporary cyberattacks, including quantum attacks. The evaluation takes into account the ability of the algorithms to be deployed on devices with limited computational resources within the infocommunication networks during the transmission of information messages.   Methodology. Software implementation, testing and validation of selected cryptographic algorithms based on Python, considering the impact of limited resources and destabilising factors, such as signal noise components, based on computer experiments were applied. The performance of the studied cryptographic algorithms was analysed using statistical data processing methods and a multi-criteria evaluation approach.   Findings. The symmetric algorithms AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 demonstrated the highest accuracy in signal recovery following encryption and decryption (MSE ranges from 1.95 · 10-6 to 5.12 · 10-5). The time taken to encrypt and decrypt I/Q signals using symmetric algorithms was found to be around 2.5 times faster than that required by the Kyber family. Computer experiments confirmed the existence of a trade-off between processing speed and security level. Symmetric algorithms are optimal for scenarios with critical processing speed requirements. However, Kyber provides greater protection reliability, albeit at the cost of additional resources. The correctness of the proposed computer model, which enables the computational and information-functional characteristics of cryptographic algorithms to be evaluated, has been proven.   Originality. Patterns of the destabilising influence of signal-to-noise ratio indicators and signal length on the accuracy of digital signal recovery after encryption have been established for different cryptographic algorithms (AES, ChaCha20 and the Kyber) in the context of their use in resource-constrained infocommunication systems.   Practical value. Implementing the computer model proved its suitability for studying cryptographic algorithms in resource-constrained environments, as well as its potential for improving information security protocols and selecting optimal algorithms based on processing speed requirements and desired security levels.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This article provides a brief analysis of the components of managerial culture, taking into account the socio-humanitarian and cultural essence of this phenomenon..formulated a contradiction between the requirements for the trajectory of further development of managerial culture in the modern humanistic paradigm and its real implementation in the practice of managing various social systems. According to the authors, the humanistic nature of theThe phenomenon of managerial culture, defined by a specific hierarchy of leadership and subordination, is genetically formed as a single system of qualities and characteristics in the natural process of historical and sociocultural development of the practice of managerial activity under the determining influence of the system of moral norms and values traditional for localized societies, giving this phenomenon its own humanistic context. The authors also proposed to consider managerial culture as a qualitative indicator of activity in the system of social relations determined by a specific hierarchy of leadership and subordination, as one of the main indicators of professionalism and morality of representatives of the managerial class, as well as assessing the effectiveness of management practice.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>This article explores the impact of digital maturity on governance and its role in promoting sustainability at the municipal level. While much attention has been given to the impact of the digital transition on industry, its adoption in the tertiary sector and its effect on municipal sustainability have been overlooked. The research conducted a two-stage empirical analysis based on secondary data from various governmental sources. First, exploratory analysis highlighting regional asymmetries. Second, regression analysis. The study focuses on both small and large municipalities, stressing regional asymmetries and offering insights into the importance of the digital transition in the pillars of sustainability. The econometric results confirm that adopting e-government strategies positively impact municipal transparency and contributes to social, economic, and environmental sustainability. These findings underscore the potential of embracing digital transition in public sector governance as an effective strategy for enhancing sustainability at the municipal level</jats:p>
