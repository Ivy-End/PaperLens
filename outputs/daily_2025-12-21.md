This study aims to present a multi-modal GAI dissertation mentor prototype, followed by an experiment within a classroom. The AI mentor was developed based on Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, where the AI agent can adapt to diverse learning styles like visual, kinesthetic and reading and/or writing.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The system comprises a multi-modal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) backend and web-based frontend interface, allowing educators to create a knowledgebase of academic resources with text, tables and images. For the experiment lecture notes, e-books and presentations pertaining to a research design unit within an undergraduate degree were used. The solution can also extract and interpret relevant images within the educator's documents. The AI mentor was evaluated in a vocational college, with learners querying about filling the college's research proposal form, methodology assistance and prompts linking theory to their context.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Results for the AI-driven experiment confirm that increased accessibility, a reliable and/or verified data corpus and the AI mentor ability to explain with language adapted to each learning style are the three main features that distinguish the specialized prototype from generic chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini. 51% of learners sitting for the pilot session preferred the kinesthetic mode, a finding in line with the college's vocational structure.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>While human interaction with the lecturer and/or mentor remains critical, the proposed AI solution augments mentorship provision beyond classroom hours and to a level of detail, which is difficult to achieve in traditional classroom or mentor meeting settings. While prior multi-modal RAG systems such as MuRAG and SAM-RAG exist, our work is distinct in applying a unified text-table-image pipeline to an educational tutor and combining this with learning style-based conditioning.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are a class of galaxies characterized by an extremely low surface brightness and large effective radius. The significance of UDGs lies in their unique properties, such as their diverse dark-matter content, which collectively challenge existing theories of galaxy formation and evolution. However, their low surface brightness and diffuse stellar distributions make UDGs particularly difficult to detect. To address this challenge, this study introduces a deep learning-based object detection model for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), named UDGnet-DES. Combined with an iterative training strategy, this model is designed to conduct a large-scale search for UDG candidates in the DES Data Release 2 (DES DR2) imaging data. Using our model, we searched UDGs from more than 500,000 DES images and further filtered the results based on surface brightness and visual inspection. As a result, we obtained a catalog of 2991 UDG samples, 39 of which have spectroscopic redshifts. An analysis of our UDG samples reveals that most objects exhibit nearly circular morphologies. Among them, blue UDGs tend to have higher surface brightnesses, while red UDGs show significant spatial clustering, in contrast to the more uniformly distributed blue UDGs.The method developed in this study can improve the efficiency of UDG searches and will be applied to the search for UDGs in the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) survey project.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>O artigo investiga lacunas na Base Nacional Comum Curricular (BNCC) relacionadas às representações de Sequências Numéricas Recorrentes (SNR) articuladas com a História da Matemática. A pesquisa é qualitativa, de natureza bibliográfica e interpretativa consubstanciando responder: quais habilidades descritas na BNCC subjazem às representações das SNR mediante ladrilhos e tabuleiros? A metodologia consistiu em uma Revisão Sistemática de Literatura (RSL) cujo corpus informativo comportou 06 produções acadêmicas classificadas nos estratos A e B do Portal CAPES publicadas no interstício compreendido entre 2015 e 2025. A instrumentalização e categorização dos dados textuais foram realizadas com base na Análise de Conteúdo e os resultados preliminares identificaram que a base não descreve explicitamente representações dessas estruturas via tabuleiros e ladrilhos. Nesse ínterim, o objetivo primordial consiste em subsidiar novas pesquisas acerca da temática, promovendo o diálogo entre a academia, o corpo docente e Secretarias de Educação, fortalecendo, assim, a Educação Matemática.                                                         </jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Cutting emissions from the global energy system will require scaling up alternatives to fossil fuels, with hydrogen increasingly viewed as a key component of this transition. Its environmental and economic performance, however, depends heavily on the production pathway. This paper presents a comparative assessment of green hydrogen, produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy, and blue hydrogen, obtained from methane reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Drawing on recent life cycle assessments (LCAs), techno-economic analyses, and policy frameworks, the study examines each pathway’s environmental impacts, cost structures, and potential applications across sectors. According to various forecasts, ongoing reductions in renewable electricity prices and improvements in electrolyzer efficiency may allow green hydrogen to achieve cost parity with blue hydrogen before 2035. Conversely, blue hydrogen tends to result in greater emissions and is subject to uncertainties associated with CCS efficiency, fluctuating fossil fuel prices, and methane leakage. Although blue hydrogen may temporarily support hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and heavy industry, its deployment must be subject to strict regulatory oversight and transparent emissions tracking. Beyond the global perspective, the paper also evaluates the relevance and feasibility of green and blue hydrogen pathways in Uruguay, considering the country’s renewable energy endowment, decarbonization goals, and emerging policy frameworks. The findings point to prioritizing green hydrogen in long-term strategies and underscore the importance of consistent LCA methodologies, expanded renewable energy infrastructure, and clear policy incentives to support a genuinely sustainable hydrogen economy.</jats:p>

In the current industrial practice, when the crane’s payload has to be accurately manipulated and located in a desired position, the task becomes laborious and risky as the operators have to guide the fine motions of the payload by hand. In the proposed collaborative scheme, the crane lifts the payload while the robot’s end-effector guides it toward the desired position.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Two admittance transfer functions are considered to accomplish harmless and smooth contact with the payload. The first admittance is used in a velocity-based admittance control integrated with the robot. The second one adds compliance to the crane by processing the interaction force through the admittance transfer function to generate a crane’s velocity command that makes the crane follow the payload.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>The robot’s end-effector and the crane move collaboratively to guide the payload to the desired location. A method is presented to design the admittance controllers that accomplish a fluent robot-crane collaboration. Simulations and experiments validating the scheme potential are shown.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This paper presents a new collaborative scheme robot-crane to manipulate heavy loads.

Our combined dataset has 3,559 firm-year observations. An ordinary least square fixed-effect regression model was used in the analysis. To assess the robustness of our results against potential endogeneity, we employ instrumental variable regression.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>                     <jats:p>Results show that the impact of institutional quality mechanisms on carbon emissions vary by cultural environment. In collectivist societies, voice and accountability significantly diminish carbon emissions, whereas rule of law enhances carbon emissions reduction in restraint societies. Voice and accountability diminish carbon emissions in long-term orientation societies but drive up emissions in short-term orientation societies. Our findings remain robust after accounting for potential endogeneity.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>                   <jats:sec>                     <jats:title>Originality/value</jats:title>                     <jats:p>This study contributes to the literature on the intersection of governance, culture and climate action. The authors present empirical evidence that institutional quality mechanisms impact total emissions and the emission types differently in heterogeneous cultural settings. This knowledge is important for developing relevant and effective strategies by the government to effectively tackle emissions problem suitable to local circumstances of countries.</jats:p>                   </jats:sec>

  - 摘要：<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>                   <jats:p>The chapter investigates the role of film and audiovisual locations in the contemporary Italian context. Adopting a political economy approach, the author suggests that nowadays Italian locations play four main roles. First, locations are strategic resources for bringing on a devolution process that is giving more and more autonomy to local governments, providing locations allows local governments to justify their role in supporting film production alongside the State and the EU. Second, Italian local governments market their territories as potential locations to attract production companies, thus boosting the local economy. In doing that, locations are useful for stimulating investments more than for bringing cultural activities to a given territory. Third, shooting in Italian locations allows global players (pay-tv broadcasters and VOD platforms) to enter the Italian market and to establish good relations with local stakeholders. Fourth, the relevance of locations in the contemporary media landscape is favouring the introduction of unusual bottom-up film policies that aim to safeguard the environment and promote sustainable film production. In conclusion, on the one hand, this analysis suggests we consider understanding locations with a greater awareness of their strategic relevance for industry and policymakers; on the other hand, it invites scholars to reconceptualise, within a wider framework, key phenomena of the film business, such as globalisation and runaway production.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>Bivalve pedicellariae are a prominent yet poorly understood morphological feature observed within specific groups within the Valvatida (Asteroidea) and have been used primarily as a taxonomic character. Seven new species, including the new genus Astrophylax which features prominent bivalve pedicellariae are described herein. In situ observations of shallow and deep-sea taxa provide possible insight into bivalve pedicellariae function. An overview of taxa which contain bivalve pedicellariae, primarily in the Goniasteridae but also the Oreasteridae and the Asteropseidae is also included. A survey of these taxa and their pedicellariae, including trends in abundance, biogeography, and depth provide further context for the understanding of these unusual characters, especially within the Goniasteridae and the Oreasteridae.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>To explore an alternative green metallization strategy for nonconductive plastics, a conductive polypyrrole (PPy) precoat was prepared by in-situ interfacial polymerization of pyrrole on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and the electrodeposition of Cu on PPy precoat was investigated using both voltage-controlled method and current-controlled method. A uniform PPy film was successfully obtained on the PCB surface through modifying the PCB wettability and optimizing the pyrrole solution. Electrochemical measurements showed that sufficient polarization was necessary for the electroreduction and growth of Cu crystals on the PPy precoat due to its high electrical resistance. The presence of through-holes adjacent to copper in PCB boards demonstrates that constant-current electroplating enables effective deposition of uniform, adherent copper layers on polypyrrole (PPy) - pretreated substrates, establishing a viable alternative to conventional electroless copper plating for through-hole metallization in PCB manufacturing.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The Bailey method is a tool that optimizes asphalt concrete mixes, considering the packing of both coarse and fine aggregates. Nonetheless, the usefulness of the Bailey for balanced mix designs has not been studied in Canada. Aggregates’ packing could influence the asphalt mixture’s resistance to distresses such as rutting and cracking. This study provides insight into the modifications and performance indicators of selected asphalt mixtures in New Brunswick. Testing included the Hamburg wheel tracking test, the ideal shear rutting test, and the indirect tensile asphalt cracking test. The test results from laboratory mixes produced according to the latest and currently approved designs were compared using various statistical analyses. The results suggest that using the Bailey method could enhance the rutting resistance while maintaining acceptable cracking resistance in asphalt mixtures. This research’s findings are relevant to identifying alternative changes or adjustments when using the balanced mix design approach.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The relocation of Sanur Port has led to a 40% decline in traders’ income, shifts in spatial functions, and the deterioration of infrastructure in the Bangsal Beach and Matahari Terbit Beach areas. This Community Service Program was implemented to address the needs of the main partners, namely BUMDA Galang Kangin Sanur, coastal traders, and the local community, through three key activities: design adaptation, masterplan revision, and construction supervision. The program began with field surveys and interviews involving 32 traders, coastal area mapping, and a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) attended by 26 representatives of BUMDA, the traditional village, and MSME groups. The planning process produced several adaptive design outputs, including the initial construction of four modular kiosks using galvanized steel structures, preparation for the improvement of a 300 meter pedestrian corridor that will be developed further depending on community interest, and the introduction of a porous drainage system to mitigate flooding. Periodic construction supervision was carried out to ensure compliance with technical specifications and material durability within the coastal environment. The outcomes of the program indicate improvements in public space comfort, fairer distribution of trading locations, and the strengthening of Balinese architectural identity through contextual design elements. Overall, this program provides direct benefits to coastal traders, BUMDA Sanur, and traditional community stakeholders, and serves as a model for implementing adaptive architectural approaches in the sustainable development of coastal areas.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>After a metro disruption, a substantial number of passengers often remain stranded despite the prompt deployment of bridging bus services. Previous studies have primarily focused on optimizing these bus services in isolation, with limited attention given to potential collaboration with short-turning metro operations. This study systematically explores the collaborative evacuation of passengers during sudden metro disruptions. We propose a collaborative scheduling model that integrates bridging bus services with short-turning metro operations. By synchronizing bus dispatching with adjusted metro schedules, the model simultaneously accommodates both stranded and newly arriving passengers. To solve the model efficiently, we develop an improved sparrow search algorithm to determine optimal scheduling strategies. A case study based on real-world data from the Fuzhou Metro system in China demonstrates that the proposed approach enables transit operators to proactively design coordinated metro-bus evacuation plans, significantly reducing total passenger waiting times along affected routes.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>The NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS) is a large programme using the NIKA2 dual-band camera on the IRAM 30,m telescope. Its goal is to improve our understanding of the physics of distant Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) by carrying out deep surveys of two fields, GOODS-North and COSMOS. This work is focussed on GOODS-North, which was observed for 78.2 hours, simultaneously at 1.2 and 2,mm, with a field of view of ∼240,arcmin^2. With such a deep integration, we were able to measure, for the first time, the confusion noise limits at the 30,m telescope using the best sampled ∼ 62,arcmin^2 and masking sources with a flux greater than 0.54 or 0.17,mJy at 1.2 or 2,mm, respectively. We found a confusion noise of $139.1^ ±11.9$,μJy/beam at 1.2,mm and $38.6^ ±3.7$,μJy/beam at 2,mm (the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the cosmic variance). In this region, this corresponds to half the instrumental noise. To derive these estimates, we devised a novel estimator, referred to as the cross variance, which also enabled us to estimate the correlated confusion noise between the two bands. Thus, we obtained a result of $49.6^ ± 6.4$,μJy/beam. These values are consistent with the state of the art Simulated Infrared Dusty Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) model.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>A. S. Tumanova analyzes prominent public events such as the professional congresses of people’s universities figures, of Russian delegates to the international union of criminologists, and of representatives of the women’s rights movement. All these events were organized in the empire’s capitals (the first two in St. Petersburg, the third in Moscow) and were a space for the expression of public discourse. They occurred at approximately the same time, in 1908–09, and symbolized the condition of the public sphere at that time, when political activity had weakened and receded into the background, and the nonpolitical sphere had evidently become a domain for public discussion of political themes and had assumed “responsibility” for the creation of rational critical discourse about a wide circle of causes that concerned the public. They were also united by the fact that their participants, in the course of free discussion, moved beyond the questions allowed for discussion, as set out in their agendas, and became absorbed in the space of the political. This paper discusses the fine line between nonpolitical and political subjects, the means of transmitting the “forbidden,” and the smooth overflow of the permitted into the forbidden.</jats:p>

  - 摘要：<jats:p>What is the problem that solidarity is invoked as a solution to? How are solidarity schemes narrated? Which particular interests are pursued in its name? In this book, leading authorities in law, philosophy and political sciences respond to the solidarity question, drawing on debates on international law, international aid, collective security, joint action, market organization and neoliberalism, international human rights across the North/South divide, African mobility, transnational labour in the digital age and populism. This volume captures the shifting nature of long held historical assumptions on solidarity. Its twelve chapters open up for differentiated understandings of solidarity in law and politics beyond discursive cliché or ideological appropriation, bringing crises of the past into conversation with the crises of today. This book is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.</jats:p>
